#
# This script can be used to run CircleMUD over and over again (i.e., have
#it
# automatically reboot if it crashes).  It will run the game, and copy some
# of the more useful information from the system logs to the 'log' directory
# for safe keeping.
#
# You can control the operation of this script by creating and deleting
#files
# in Circle's root directory, either manually or by using the 'shutdown'
# command from within the MUD.
#
# Creating a file called .fastboot makes the script wait only 5 seconds
# between reboot attempts instead of the usual 60.  If you want a quick
# reboot, use the "shutdown reboot" command from within the MUD.
#
# Creating a file called .killscript makes the script terminate (i.e., stop
# rebooting the MUD).  If you want to shut down the MUD and make it stay
# shut down, use the "shutdown die" command from within the MUD.
#
# Finally, if a file called pause exists, the script will not reboot the MUD
# again until pause is removed.  This is useful if you want to turn the MUD
# off for a couple of minutes and then bring it back up without killing the
# script.  Type "shutdown pause" from within the MUD to activate this
#feature.
#

# The port on which to run the MUD
PORT=5000

# Default flags to pass to the MUD server (see running.doc for a description
# of all flags).
