An undead zombie sits here munching on something ...
~
His body is totally white and slowly rotting away.  Each Zombie looks
quite different from the next because they were, of course, once alive and
human.

You spot a wraith advancing towards you from the shadows.

in his eyes.

undead guardian vampire~
the guardian vampire~
A vampire is here hiding his face from your light source.
~
The guardian vampire looks quite EVIL.  Just by looking at him the hair on your
arms raises. He looks mighty tough to be just a minor minion.
It seems like he doesn't like to be asked any questions, enjoying his peace.

A priest of God stands here solemnly speaking words of praise.
~
Obviously a goodly man, you feel closer to God just by gazing upon this man.
Dressed in white, fine white hair, and a soft slightly wrinkled face ...
this man has a sacred beauty.  You see a halo around his head.

Mi-Go Fungi~
the Mi-Go~
A Mi-Go is crawling here.
~
Mi-Go, the Fungi from Yuggoth ... it is a pinkish being about five feet long;
with a crustaceous body bearing a vast pair of membranous wings and several
sets of articulate limbs, body a sort of convoluted ellipsoid, covered with
multitudes of very small antennae, where a head would ordinarily be.  These
beings sometimes walk on all their legs and sometimes on the hind pair only.

A nightgaunt is standing here
~
... shocking and uncouth black thing with smooth, oily, skin, unpleasant horns
that curve inward toward each other, bat wings whose beating make no sound,
ugly prehensile paws, and a barbed tail that lashes disquietingly.  And worst
of all, it makes absolutely no sound or speech and smiles not at all because
it has no face, only a suggestive blackness where a face ought to be ...

hunting horror~
the hunting horror~
The hunting horror is here in wait of an unwary traveler.
~
Serving Nyarlathotep and Roch'tar, these beings are hunting for victims.
They resemble enormous ropy black serpents or worms possessing bat-like or
umbrella-like wings.  Their forms continually shift and change, twitching
and writhing, so it is hard to look at them.  They speak in great harsh
voices.  A hunting horror is HUGE, normally around 40 feet long.

What an ugly fiend! He is about 6'6'' and has mostly greenish skin with
bright red hair. Half his face is burnt off and he has a perpetual smile.
He is called up from his service in hell in order to aid the Undying One.

An X-ist flesh eater is sitting here munching on some coffin remains
~
A large hairy monstrous beast, the only LIVE thing you have seen down here.
It stands approximately 8 feet tall and hunches over to fit in this
small room.  It has a pair of tremendous claws that it uses to rip and tear.
It has dog-like face except ... different.  Bright glowing eyes and a grimace
lead you to believe that he knew that you were coming.

the spirit of King Crotus~
The spirit of King Crotus is floating lazily above the floor.
~
Floating above the ground here and looking a bit dead, he whispers
softly into the air:

    The forces of evil have unlocked my spirit as
    well as one other.  Free me from this misery,
    anyone that can hear. The peace of the grave
    calls me but I am blocked from its quiet.

etcher~
the mad etcher~
The mad etcher is sitting here babbling to himself and working on the wall.
~
Quite insane, the mad etcher has been here for two decades.  His hair is
white; he babbles nonsense to himself; a layer of dust covers his out-of-date
clothing; and he seems to be working on the same portion of the wall near
the base ... oh and he seems quite blind.

He leers insanely at you and says 'heh heh what can I do for you children?
Please don't mind my wife, she is always like that ... hello dear can you
make some tea for our company?  Oh good!  Now sit right down will you?
Would you like hot or cold tea?  Yes the weather is ...'

And on he babbles ...

the spectral etcher's wife~
The spectral wife of the etcher is very faintly floating here.
~
You can barely make her out ... though it almost makes you vomit.
She is missing half her head.  The remaining half is smashed in horribly like
she took a nasty fall.  Her one damaged eye hangs on its own.  She smiles
insanely at you thru a broken jaw and missing teeth.  One hand of hers is
resting on the shoulder of the etcher ... her husband.
