The End Of The Long Tunnel~
  You are standing at the end of this dark tunnel. There is almost no fresh 
air in here, and it feels like no one passed these halls for centuries. To the 
south you see a little spot of bright light. It is unbelievable that this 
tunnel led you so deep underground. To the north you see a huge archway carved 
out in the black rock.

In The Darkness~
  As you step trough the archway you realize that there is no floor in this 
room. You start to fall, and fall, and fall...

It seems that you fall forever. You cannot tell how much time you spent 
falling through the darkness. But suddenly, you find yourself standing on the 
stone floor. In the distance you see some light.

Before An Enormous Gates~
  It is very HOT in here! You are sweating like never before, and
the red light that is apparently emanating from behind the gate is so bright 
that you turn your head away. You have reached the foothold of this gate. It 
looks very weird. It is changing and shifting before your eyes, like it is 
being made of living bodies. YUCK!!!

The Fire Path~
  You stand on a path that is made out of FIRE! You can't explain how you 
menage not to fall into the abyss below. Strange blue flames engulf you and 
the thick toxic vapors burn your lungs as you inhale, and dry your mouth as 
you exhale. You sweat like newer before but the heat drinks every last drop of 
it. The path continues to the north. You also hear a bubbling of the water to 
the east.

notice a hole in the east wall below the surface. It doesn't look too hard 
to dive through it. You feel the water. It is pretty hot.

In The Hot Wather~
  The second after you dive in the pond, a powerful current pulls you in the 
cave wall. You are twisting ant turning in the very hot water. You finally 
stop deep inside some underwater cavern. You will drown if you don't find an 
exit soon. Your lungs are gasping for air.

great bowl. On the horizon, in the distance, behind giant mountains you see

On The Top Of The Steps~
  As you pass through the door, it mysteriously vanishes behind you. You jump
in fear as you realize that you stand on a very small platform that seem to
be floating in the air. All around you there is abyss... darkness. But
suddenly you realize that this platform is in fact the top of the THOUSAND
STEPS OF Hive.
  You look down and it makes you dizzy. All of the steps seem to be floating 
in the air and it's spiral shape goes down in the darkness. You don't seem to 
be able to see the end of the steps. In the distance of this depths you see a 
glow of some kind of fire.

The Seventh Circle~
  You have reached another turn. This time the path stretches to the east.
There seems to be an entrance at this side of the temple. As you see this
your fears are gone, like blown away by the wind.

  You hurry down the path. You feel very unsafe and exposed here outside.
Some huge boulders stand at the each side of the path, increasing in height
as you approach the entrance. As you examine one closely, you see that their
surface is carved... Carved by some huge claws.

Before The Temple Entrance~
  You have reached the entrance to the dark temple. It is shaped like a large
mouth with it's tongue slipped out across the acid trench. But when you watch
closely you see the trembling of the mouth and it's teeth. You see the slight
shaking and moisture of the tongue. It is like the mouth is just urging to
keep still, just so you enter them. They seem so alive.
  You stand here unsure of yourself and finally notice a sign hanging down
from the stone archway, before the mouth.

  The path trough the mouth was not very pleasant. The muscle of the large
tongue moved beneath your feet, as you stepped on it. When you entered the
mouth completely, you slipped and fell down the dark throat. For some seconds
that seemed like hours, you twisted and turned through dark, slippery and wet
tunnel. Finally you landed on a cold and dark rock of the interior. 
  Tunnels were lit by torches hanging down from the walls, but somehow the
walls themselves drenched the light so it was very dark. You fear of what
could jump you around the corner.

  You stand in the NINTH CIRCLE OF Hive!!! Walls of fire burn the sky as far
as your eyes can see. The immense heat should melt you down instantly, and
sulfur vapors should choke you to death long ago... but, somehow... your
will and hope that had driven you this far, now gives you protection in this
forever damned place.

The Throne of Demon Lord~
  You stand before a 10 feet high throne, made out of damned souls, and their
blood and flesh. This is the trone of Demon Lord, ruler of the Hive! 
As you look at it, you feel your eyes will burn, and your soul slip through
them nad join other on the throne. In your head you hear billions of screams,
and you fear that you might become one of them.
