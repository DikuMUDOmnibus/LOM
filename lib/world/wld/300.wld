The End Of The Long Tunnel~

  You are standing at the end of this dark tunnel. There is almost no fresh 
air in here, and it feels like no one passed these halls for centuries. To the 
south you see a little spot of bright light. It is unbelievable that this 
tunnel led you so deep underground. To the north you see a huge archway carved 
out in the black rock.

  As you step trough the archway you realize that there is no floor in this 
room. You start to fall, and fall, and fall...

It seems that you fall forever. You cannot tell how much time you spent 
falling through the darkness. But suddenly, you find yourself standing on the 
stone floor. In the distance you see some light.

Before An Enormous Gates~

  It is very HOT in here! You are sweating like never before, and
the red light that is apparently emanating from behind the gate is so bright 
that you turn your head away. You have reached the foothold of this gate. It 
looks very weird. It is changing and shifting before your eyes, like it is 
being made of living bodies. YUCK!!!

The Fire Path~

  You stand on a path that is made out of FIRE! You can't explain how you 
menage not to fall into the abyss below. Strange blue flames engulf you and 
the thick toxic vapors burn your lungs as you inhale, and dry your mouth as 
you exhale. You sweat like newer before but the heat drinks every last drop of 
it. You see an exit to the west.

On The Top Of The Steps~

  As you pass through the door, it mysteriously vanishes behind you. You jump
in fear as you realize that you stand on a very small platform that seem to
be floating in the air. All around you there is abyss... darkness. But
suddenly you realize that this platform is in fact the top of the &WTHOUSAND
STEPS&0 OF Hive.

  You look down and it makes you dizzy. All of the steps seem to be floating 
in the air and it's spiral shape goes down in the darkness. You don't seem to 
be able to see the end of the steps. In the distance of this depths you see a 
glow of some kind of fire.

Entrance To The Seventh Circle~

  You are stancing in a small crater. Before you stands an ancient temple. You
feel evil emanating from the walls of the temple. The temple is surrounded by
a trench filled with some kind of acid. You don't feel like a swim.

Before The Temple Entrance~

  You have reached the entrance to the dark temple. It is shaped like a large
mouth with it's tongue slipped out across the acid trench. But when you watch
closely you see the trembling of the mouth and it's teeth. You see the slight
shaking and moisture of the tongue. It is like the mouth is just urging to
keep still, just so you enter them. They seem so alive.

  You stand here unsure of yourself and finally notice a &wsign&0 hanging down
from the stone archway, before the mouth.

The Temple Of Lost Souls~

  The path trough the mouth was not very pleasant. The muscle of the large
tongue moved beneath your feet, as you stepped on it. When you entered the
mouth completely, you slipped and fell down the dark throat. For some seconds
that seemed like hours, you twisted and turned through dark, slippery and wet
tunnel. Finally you landed on a cold and dark rock of the interior. 

  Tunnels were lit by torches hanging down from the walls, but somehow the
walls themselves drenched the light so it was very dark. You fear of what
could jump you around the corner.

The Temple Of Lost Souls~

  With tears in your eyes and pain in your soul you reach the enormus shaft.
It is conelike, and leads down... not surpassingly. You decide to jump in. 
You would face anything else, rather than the pain and fear in the Temple of
lost souls!

The Eight Circle~

  You open your eyes as you land in the eight circle, but wish that you never
had opened them. The walls of this circle are made out of &RLIVING tissue&0. You
see the blood flowing through the veins in the musclelike tissue of the walls
that is also pulsating with life. But when you look closely you notice human
forms that are captured inside these walls and are moving them, trying to 
escape. The life is emanating from this captured souls. You feel utterly
sick and disgusted.

The Throne Of Demon Lord~

  You stand before a 10 feet high throne, made out of damned souls, and their
blood and flesh. This is the trone of &RDemon Lord&0, ruler of the Hive!
 
  As you look at it, you feel your eyes will burn, and your soul slip through
them nad join other on the throne. In your head you hear billions of screams,
and you fear that you might become one of them.

The Terace Above The Hive~

  You are standing on a nice terace that overlooks the whole Hive. It has
a table and some chairs and it would look perfectly idilic if only there 
was some sky above it. This could only come out of twisted mind of some
area creator...

  There is also a &Bsign&0 mounted on the wall.

Handy Room~

  Nothing special here. Seems that the only purpose of this room is to load
and unload some mobs.
