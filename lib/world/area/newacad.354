The Laboratory of Skills and Spells~
This is where you will practice your arsenal of weapons, spells and skills.
Type PRACTICE to get a list of these currently available to you.  Everyone
will have sections listing skills, weapons and languages.  Spells casters
will have an additional section for spells.  To practice a spell, skill or
weapons style, type PRACTICE <full name of spell, skill or weapon style>.
 
For instance, to practice dispel magic, you would type PRAC DISPEL MAGIC.
When practicing, you start at 0% and one practice will earn you between
15% and 20% proficieny.  Additional knowledge is gained through usage of
the skill or spell until adept, which is a maximum of 30% - 95%.
 
To get see information using spells, skills or weapons, type HELP CAST or
HELP <spell, skill or weapon style>.  For general questions on practicing,
type HELP PRACTICE.  The number of practice sessions you may gain at each
level is determined by the amount of wisdom you have when you level.

The Reading Room~
This is a silent room, which means while here you will not see any of the
channels. In fact, you can only use socials, emotes and group tell here.
The room was created to give you a quiet place to read our help files.
You can reduce your own screen scroll by reducing the number of channels 
you receive. You can get a full list of channels by typing CHAN. You may 
turn off a channel by type CHAN -<channel> and reactive a channel by 
typing CHAN +<channel>. For example, you can turn off auction channel by 
type CHAN -AUCTION and you can turn it back on by typing CHAN +AUCTION. 
You can also turn off ALL your channels by typing CHAN -ALL and turn them 
all on again by typing CHAN +ALL. Once you have finished reading, you are
ready to test your ability to negotiate your way around.
Going west will take you into another part of the Academy. The test is to
follow all the room descriptions until you can find your way back to this 
point. If at any time you become lost, type U to return to this room. Once 
you have successfully returned here, please continue to the north to
explore the rest of the Academy.

Chamber of Trials for Rangers~
Here you will experience your first full combat against MOBILES, also known
as MOBS. Mobile is the name used for monsters and the like in the game.
All exits, except down, lead to a CAGE mob. Some of these cage mobs may be
aggressive and will attack you upon entering their room. As you kill them, 
you will gain experience, as well as academy equipment and gold. Once you 
have defeated a mob, type GET ALL CORPSE to loot the coins and equipment.
You may also type CONFIG +AUTOLOOT or CONFIG +AUTOGOLD. Autoloot will take
everything from the corpse when you kill it. Autogold will take only the
gold from the corpse. When you loot a corpse of equipment, the items are
transferred to your inventory. You may suffer injury during the battle, so 
return here and type REST or SLEEP. This will speed your healing process. 
When you are finished healing, type WAKE or STAND to continue.

Abbigayle's Language Lessons~
This is where you LEARN your LANGUAGES.  Languages are learned differently
than spells, skills and weapons, as you must be adept ata language before
you may use it.  To see a list of the languages available to you, simply
type PRACTICE.  You do not need to learn the TONGUE of your race nor the
common language, as they both come naturally to you.  To learn a language,
type LANGUAGE LEARN <language type>.
 
For more information on how to learn a language, type HELP LANGUAGES.  To
learn how to use languages, type HELP SPEAK and HELP TONGUE.  It will cost
a few practice sessions each time you wish to increase your fluency in a
language.  Those who are intelligent, wise and lucky will find it takes
fewer practice sessions to become adept at a language.

Wandering the Academy~
Each player has a menu of items that the game controls automatically once
it has been configured. To get a list of this menu, type CONFIG. For this
part of your schooling, it is suggested you type CONFIG +AUTOEXIT. This
will have the mud show you all obvious exits available to you. When you
are moving around the game, EXIT is a very important command. When you
type EXIT, it shows you the room names each exit shown under obvious exits.
You can use this command to get hints of dangers and death traps that might
be close by. You may also try to LOOK in adjoining rooms. You do this by
typing LOOK <direction>. Your next move is to the west, to see what you
are walking into, try typing EXIT and L W.

A Dank Pit~
Here stands a Chadoyn.  He was captured trying to slaughter the students
of the Academy, and the Immortals decided to spare his life and throw him
in chains for use as a teaching aid.  With him you can practice attacking
and fleeing, but hopefully not dying.  You will also want to make use of
the 'consider' command.  This command compares your level and hitpoints
to that of the creature.  To use here, type 'con chadoyn'.
 
To use the consider command elsewhere, type CON <MOBNAME>.  It is wise to
ALWAYS consider a mob before fighting it the first time.  This will many
times save your life, as mobs are often a lot more difficult then they
outwardly appear.  Be careful and enjoy your fight.

Wandering Darkhaven Academy~
This is where you will start learning about exits not listed under "Exits".
Doors are not seen on the game. You must read room description and LOOK
<direction> to find them. Another method of finding a door is to "bump" into
the walls. Type N. OUCH! You ran into the door. You want to be careful not
to be affected with the pass door spell while using the bump method, as you
may end up in a room you would rather not visit. Now, type OPEN N or OPEN
DOOR. Next type EXIT, you will now see the north exit listed under "Exits".
Type HELP OPEN to find out more information on doors.

An Enclosed Room~
You did it! Well done. You will find many rooms such as this all over the
game. Some are easy to find because of hints in the room descriptions.
Some are very hard to find, as the clues could be rooms away. However, you
are now armed with the tools to locate them. You know how to use "look", 
bump, and "exit". Many classes also get a spell called "scry". This spell
will allow the person affected by it to see the into the adjoining rooms.
It is used like "look", but gives you more detailed information. To see if
you gain the scry spell at a later level, type SLIST. This will give you a
list of all spells, skills and weapon types you may practice. Slist also
gives you information on what level you may practice each, to what percent
you are currently practiced in each, and what the maximum percent that you
may practice each.

Lost in Darkhaven Academy~
There are several special exit types that you may encounter in your travels.
You have experienced open exits and closed doors to this point. There are
also hidden doors. The hidden door can not be found with the "bump" method.
Often they will not show up with the "look" method either. These exits are
found by reading room descriptions, mobiles descriptions and looking at
objects. You are looking for words that stand out, those words will be the
door name. You will also find doors that are locked. You may get past some
locked doors with the pass door spell, the pick door skill or bash door skill.
Some doors may only be passed by using the matching key. Other exits you
may find require you to be skilled in climb or affected by the fly spell.
All exits are in real directions that can be abbreviated to the following:
N, E, W, S, NE, NW, SE, SW, U, or D. There are also SOMEWHERE exits that
use "leave", "climb", "enter", or just a word to use. To the north you
will experience a hidden exit, use the room description to find the door name.

You are standing in a richly decorated room. A large oak table surrounded
by twelve chairs dominates a large portion of the area. Crystal globes with
continual light spells cast on them hover about the room, providing a soft
comfortable light. The walls are adorned with tapestries of the finest
quality. The tapestry on the west wall draws your attention more so than
the others. Now, you have many clues on the possible exit. Try to find the
right word by typing LOOK <word>. For example, try LOOK GLOBES. Sometimes
looking at other things in the rooms description will lead you to the word
that will open the exit.

descriptions and items, this will many times bring profitable results.
This is a where you will experience a Somewhere exit. To find your way
out, try looking at the picture on the wall. If you can not figure it out, 
you may leave by the up exit. Good luck!

The time is drawing near to experience combat.  Directly below you now is
the Chadoyn Pit, the home of a creature which will assist you in learning
how to initiate combat.  The Chadoyn is not aggressive, which means you
must begin the fight.  There are many ways to start a fight, the quickest
way is to type KILL <mob>.  As you gain skills and spells, you may find
many of them are also capable of initiating combat.
 
Some of the more popular spells used to start an attack are DISPEL MAGIC,
SLEEP, CHARM PERSON, BLINDNESS, WEAKEN, CURSE, and FAERIE FIRE.  Some of
the most popular skills used to begin an attack are STEAL and BACKSTAB.
  ** These skills and spells WILL also begin an attack on a player **
 
Wands, staves and scrolls may also be used to start fights.

This room explains about WIMPY, FLEE, and RECALL as a way to leave from
combat. Wimpy is an automatic withdrawal from a fight when your hitpoints
reach a set minimum. To set your wimpy, type WIMPY or WIMPY <number>. The
number being the amount of hitpoints you want remaining when you leave the
battle. You will lose experience for wimpying out of a fight, but the amount
of experience lost will generally be less then the amount lost from death.
You may also manually withdraw from a fight with flee. To use flee, just
type FLEE. You may flee out of the fight at any amount of hitpoints. Fleeing
will cost you loss of experience. You may also "recall" from a fight. This
is done with the spell "word of recall" or reciting a recall scroll. You 
lose more experience when you recall from a fight then when you use wimpy
or flee. Recall should be used as a last resort.

This is a healer. You will find many of them throughout the game. Their
purpose is to cast spells of armor, bless, cure blindness, cure poison, 
cure light, and refresh. The healer casts these spells randomly to the
characters in the room. Some healers have programs that will allow you
to purchase certain spells for coins. Others have programs that will give
you a spell when you say a certain word or phrase, or do a certain social
to them. It is important to look at mobiles to read their descriptions.
Many will have hints in their descriptions that will tell you what to
say or do to get their favor.

I have enjoyed writing the revision of the Darkhaven Academy. I wanted
the new players armed with as much information as possible before venturing
into the open game. Take your time here, learning the commands and seeing
how the programs on the mobs and items work. It will help you later in your
travels. If you have trouble understanding anything you find in the Academy,
type WHO 51 and ask an immortal for assistance. I wish you well in your
adventuring. May you enjoy many hours of joy and develop many friendships.

                     Warm Huggles,

This is the stage of your training where you may begin to feel pangs of
hunger and a parched throat. In other words, you need food and drink.
To the east is the Darkhaven Supply Store. You may purchase water and
some meat. Once you have eaten and drunk, you will be ready to proceed
north.

you may bribe the storekeeper to give you an item. There are many mobs
in this world that will sell you keys, items or information in exchange
for a few gold coins. Be sure to look at the mobiles for hints on these

In this part of the academy you will learn about the Death Trap, more
commonly known as a DT. A death trap is exactly as its name states, a
room that causes your death. Unlike a regular death, you do not lose
your hitpoints and you do not leave a corpse behind. All the items you 
were wearing and carrying are destroyed. You do not leave a corpse behind.
You are then transported back to the Temple in Darkhaven. Going west will
give you more information about death traps.

This is what you will see if you stumble into a death trap.  As previously
stated, a DT kills instantaneously and destroys any and all equipment you
have at the time.  Hints as to the placement of a death trap are sometimes
given in the room that preceeds them.  Also remember to use "exit" and
"look" to find these deadly rooms.  Note:  no DTS are found in Darkhaven.

A dark tunnel below the Battlegrounds~
Darkness engulfs this tunnel, making it impossible to see without a
light source.  Water drips slowly down the tunnel walls, adding to
the moisture in the soil and humidity in the air.  This place does
appear to be very welcoming.

The walls of this tunnel are close, barely allowing you passage.
The earth under your feet is damp and sticking to your boots.  A
squeal can be heard coming from the south.  You may want to return
