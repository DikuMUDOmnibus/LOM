Ophelia's Padded Cell~
You walk into Ophelia's office, and find it like no other room you've seen.  
Thick padding covers the entire room:  walls, floor, ceiling.  Could it be
that it is to protect herself, or could it have some other, some kinky
function?  You feel the walls and floor, their surface is made of satin and the
filling feels soft as a cloud.  It is so comfortable you could sleep on it...
or do other things.  There is no furniture in the room, only pillows and 
blankets of various sizes and textures.  A chandelier hangs from the ceiling
in the center of the room; it's dim candles bestow the room with it's only
source of light.

A Path into the Forest~
You are on a path into the Forest of Acacia.  Wildflowers grow on either side
of the path in between the berry bushes.  The cobblestone path looks rather
worn beneath your feet, yet looks like it will last many more years.  Up in the
distance you spot the forest, and sigh with relief.  The forest is a peaceful
place to relax in.  You pick up your tired feet and tread onward.

An Intersection of Paths~
While walking along the path towards the forest, you come across an old
interestion.  The path is worn in this area more than the along rest of the
paths, but the scenery is still abundant with fragrant wildflowers and berry
bushes.  You peer in each of the directions you could go, but find it hard to
decide.  You could either continue north, or go east onto the side path.

A Small Side Path~
This dirt path you find yourself on is narrow and looks like it hasn't been
used in years.  Wildflowers and plants grow wild and rampant along the side of
the path.  There are also some plants creeping onto the path itself.  You
almost decide to turn around and go back onto the main path, but as you peer
above the tall weeds you see a building up ahead.  With caution, you venture
further along towards the building.

Before a Small Cottage~
You stand in front of an old cottage.  The flowers around the front have been
overtaken by weeds and the shingles on the roof are falling apart.  You imagine
that this cottage must have been in good shape while in its prime, but years of
neglet have left this building a mere shadow of its former glory.  You are
unable to make out anything through the dust-covered windows, so you decide to
try entering through the creaky door.

Mina's Cottage~
This is the cottage of Mina, who lives alone at the edge of the forest.  Legend
has it that she went insane after she was abandoned by her lover.  This entry-
way is covered with a thick layer of dust, and cobwebs are in every corner.
The once clean tile floor is not cracked and stained.  This room doesn't look
like it has been entered in years, you you hear odd sounds coming from above.

A Druid's Circle~
Looking up and around, you find yourself surrounded by large pillars of stone.
The pillars tower high above your head, and are arranged into a large circle.
They look very heavy, and hard to move.  The druid's of the area must have done
it, but you can't imagine how--the pillars are so big!  Standing in the very
center of the circle, you feel a magical power surround you.  You feel safe
here, and wouldn't mind staying.

A Dead End in the Path~
You find yourself on a little side path, but you discover that you can go no
further.  A huge rotting log has fallen over the path, preventing you from
going further.  Getting up on your toes, you manage to barely see above the
massive log.  The forest looks dark and spooky past the log, and you feel
grateful that something is blocking your way.  You turn around and go back to
the main path.
   A HUGE log is here, blocking your way.

way to get around it.

A Trail to the Fountain~
This trail is much more luxurious than the path you just came off of.  Looking
down at your feet, the trail is covered with an expensive looking tile--it
looks like the tile has gold inlay.  The flowers are well kept and trimmed
nicely, much different from other parts of the path.  You wonder to yourself
why this area looks so much nicer, then walk further on towards the fountain.

of the once magnificent fountain.  This area is landscaped just as nice as the
trail and courtyard, with many colorful flowers and large shade trees.  This
area would be a nice place to stay in, but you decide to move on and see the
beauty of the great old fountain.

The Gilded Fountain~
You find yourself in a small courtyard filled with many colorful flowers and
surrounded by trees that shelter it from the rest of the forest.  In the center
of the courtyard stands an old fountain, surrounded by statues of pixies and
forest animals, and gilded in gold.  This old fountain is no longer functional,
but it is still a beautiful place to sit and rest your feet.
  An old gilded fountain is here, depicting pixies playing with forest animals.

life-giving water, mostly because it no longer has ANY water to give.

The Kitchen~
Upon entering the cottage's kitchen, you think to yourself that someone must
still live in this old place.  The floors and walls are covered with a thick
layer of dust, but the dishes and plated are all newly cleaned and set out to
dry.  The tabletop is still dusty, but there are two places set on the wood
table, complete with wine glasses and candleabra.

At one time, this room must have been a wonderful place to sit and relax.
Years of neglet has taken its toll on Mina's sitting room, leaving it dusty and
full of cobwebs.  On the wall, you see a portrait of a man and a woman.  The
woman's eyes are full of love, but the man shows no love in return.  The woman
must be Mina, and the man her lover.  You rub your finger across the dusty
canvas, feeling pity for this poor woman.

An Overgrown Garden~
As you step out the back door of the cottage, you find yourself in a garden
that has been neglected for many years.  At one time it must have been a
beautiful fragrant garden, with bushes of lavender, peppermint, and basil.
But now, the garden is overrun with weeds and the plants grown wild and
unattended.  Beneath your feet you see a small path leading through the garden,
but it is completely covered with thorny weeds.

are cobwebs and dust everywhere.  What is different, however, is that this
room looks like it has been lived in.  There are clothes gently layed on the
poster bed, and there are perfume and make-up bottles neatly arranged on the
vanity.  The disgustingly strong smell of gardenia hits your nose.

You have finally made it--before you stands the lovely Forest of Acacia.
The many different trees and flowers in full bloom give you a wonderful first
impression; you imagine that the sights will only get better as you enter the
forest and go deeper into it.  Bright sunshine shines down upon you, and bathes
the forest in light.  You enter the forest feeling safe and secure.

You have come to the end of the dark trail.  A huge rotted log has blocked your
way, preventing you from going further.  Soon you realize that you are on the
other side of the large log that blocked your way before you entered the
forest.  This dark corner is full of creepy shadows and strange noises--you
can't wait to get away from here.  Your only option is to turn around and head
back the way you came.

This trail is much darker, and scarier, then any other place in the forest.
The trees are much closer together here, making it almost impossible for you to
go into the forest itself.  Even if you could, you decide that going into the
forest here would be a bad idea anyway, because you hear many strange noises
coming from inside the forest.  While the trail is still dark and spooky, you
decide to stay on it because the forest is even spookier.

This bridge you now stand on is very unstable!  It is only a small rope bridge,
and it appears that the ropes are going to snap at any moment.  The density of
the tree branches above you shuts out almost all light, making it difficult to
see in front of you.  One wrong move and you are in the river below.  You had
better run to the other side quickly, or try your luck down below in the river.

A Beaver's Dam~
The watery path you were taking comes to an abrupt end when you find yourself
at a beaver dam.  The dam is built very well with many branches and logs.
Beaver ingenuity is amazing, you realize, because the entire dam appears to be
completely waterproof.  There are noises coming from inside the dam, noises
most likely made by a beaver family.  You hold your breath and dive down to

A Small Flowing River~
You are in a small river, which is flowing at a semi-swift pace.  Its water is 
crystal clear and you can see down to the rocky bottom.  On either side of you,
past the river's bank, is the forest.  The river's flowing water reaches to
just below your waist.  If the currents were any stronger, you would be swept
downstream with little chance of survival.  Knowing this, you decide to be
extra careful.

Sapphire Lake~
You are now on the beautiful surface of Sapphire Lake.  The lake is
appropriately titled, you discover, because the depths of the lake are the most
magnificent deep blue you have even seen--like that of a brilliant sapphire. 
The water in the lake is a bit chilly, but you find it refreshing after your
adventures.  Looking down, you don't see a bottom, only endless blue.  With
this in mind, you decide to stay on the surface.
   To the southeast you see a continuation of the river flow out of the lake.

The Mouth of the River~
You have come to the end of the river.  It's water flows gracefully through the
mouth and into the beautiful Sapphire Lake.  The water feels nice and
refreshing as it rushes past your body.  As the river's clear water flows past
you, it is immediately swallowed up by the deep blue waters of the lake.  All
around you are the shimmering waters of Sapphire Lake, and northeast will take
you into the river.

You are underneath the bridge, but find nothing special.  The clear water of
the river reaches just below your waist, but is not quite strong enough to
sweep you downstream.  Still, you must be careful because the water could pick 
up and knock you off your feet, and then it is doubtful you would survive.
Looking up past the bridge and the river's bank, you see the forest.  You could
go up to the bridge, or go along the river and see where it leads.

A Bubbling Spring~
This spring is the source of all water flowing through the river and Sapphire
Lake.  It bubbles up from a underground source, making the water pure and
clear.  The water in the spring is shallow enough for you to stand up and walk
around easily.  Below the surface you see something sparkle, but as you reach
your hand down to grab it, the sparkling thing disappears.  As this happens,
you hear giggling to the north, in the trees.

The Nymph's Meadow~
You have found a small meadow next to the spring, completely hidden by the
surrounding trees.  It could also be the perfect little romantic hideaway.  The
meadow is filled with flowers of every color and style imaginable.  It is truly
one of the most beautiful places you've ever been to.  Also, with the gentle
sound of the gurgling spring, it is a very relaxing and peaceful place to be.

Inside the Dam~
You are now inside the beaver's dam.  It is small in here, but cozy.  The walls
are made of the same material as the dam itself, and not a drop of water is
leaking through the walls.  The only way in or out of the dam is the small hole
that you just swam through.  The rest of the dam has a soft floor made of
small twigs and hay.  You try to stand up on the floor, but find that there is
only room enough for you to kneel.

You are inside a forest full of soaring trees, fragrant flowers, and abundant

certain places, rows in others, while still other areas seem to be without
trees at all.  These unusual arrangements make natural paths throughout the
forest, preventing you from going in certain directions.  You look carefully
to see which ways the forest has allowed you to travel in this area.

In the Forest of Acacia~
You are inside a forest full of soaring trees, fragrant flowers, and abundant
berry bushes--the Forest of Acacia.  The trees have grown up in clumps in
certain places, rows in others, while still other areas seem to be without
trees at all.  These unusual arrangements make natural paths throughout the
forest, preventing you from going in certain directions.  You look carefully
to see which ways the forest has allowed you to travel in this area.

Overlooking the Lake~
You stand on a cliff overlooking Sapphire Lake.  The cliff is perfectly 
vertical, making it impossible to climb down it.  The forest surrounds the lake
and cliffs.  The lake is an incredible sight from where you stand; the deep
blue water shimmers brilliantly.  You step toward the edge of the cliff, but as
you do some of it crumbles and falls.  You decide to stay away from there.

Inside the Dam~
You are now inside the beaver's dam.  It is small in here, but cozy.  The walls
are made of the same material as the dam itself, and not a drop of water is
leaking through the walls.  The only way in or out of the dam is the small hole
that you just swam through.  The rest of the dam has a soft floor made of
small twigs and hay.  You try to stand up on the floor, but find that there is
only room enough for you to kneel.

A Crumbling Arch~
Upon examining the cliffs here, you can see that there used to be a natural
bridge extending northwest to the other side.  The middle section of the arch
has crumbled and fallen into the water below, making it impossible for you to
cross.  You walk out as far as you can go and look down; below you is where the
river and lake meet.  It is a magnificent view here, and would you like to stay
and enjoy it; however, the rest of the arch could crumble at any moment.

An Empty Meadow~
This place you have stumbled upon looks nothing like the rest of the forest: 
there is nothing here except grass!  You would expect to find trees here,
considering it is a forest you are in, but no.  There are not even flowers or 
shrubbery in here.  As you bend down to feel the grass, you discover that it
is prickly, and not at all pleasant.  In fact, one of the blades of grass
drew blood from your finger!

The Great Oak Tree~
Surrounded by smaller, less majestic trees, you see a giant oak tree.  It
towers high above any other tree in the forest, making the forest look like it 
is just a bunch of saplings.  You feel a strange presence here, a spiritual 
one.  Could it be the Great Oak itself?  While asking yourself this question,
you see small notches made into the side of the tree.  They are just big enough
for you to fit your hands and feet into.  Should you climb up?

A Crumbling Arch~
Upon examining the cliffs here, you can see that there used to be a natural
bridge extending northwest to the other side.  The middle section of the arch
has crumbled and fallen into the water below, making it impossible for you to
cross.  You walk out as far as you can go and look down; below you is where the
river and lake meet.  It is a magnificent view here, and would you like to stay
and enjoy it; however, the rest of the arch could crumble at any moment.

The Bank of the River~
You are on the river's bank; it is covered with a blanket of soft, deep green
grasses.  The clear water below looks inviting and refreshing, but a steep,
almost vertical cliff prevents you from climbing down to the river.  Even if
you did slide down into the river, you see no visible way of getting out.
Instead, you decide to stay in the soft grass and relax a moment.

While standing along the bank of the river, you look north and see a wooden

the river and to the rest of the forest.  From here, the bridge looks strong
enough to hold your weight and then some; you decide to make your way towards
it, eager to see what lies beyond.

A Wooden Bridge~
Beneath your feet is an old wooden bridge.  It is painted a crisp white, and is
a great contrast from the greens and browns of the forest.  There is also a
railing that reaches your waist.  On the left side of the bridge you see a hole
in this railing.  You examine the hole, and see that it is big enough for you
to go through.  You could also reach the river from the hole.  Should you go

The Bank of the River~
You are on the river's bank; it is covered with a blanket of soft, deep green
grasses.  The clear water below looks inviting and refreshing, but a steep,
almost vertical cliff prevents you from climbing down to the river.  Even if
you did slide down into the river, you see no visible way of getting out.
Instead, you decide to stay in the soft grass and relax a moment.

A Crumbling Arch~
Upon examining the cliffs here, you can see that there used to be a natural
bridge extending southeast to the other side.  The middle section of the arch
has crumbled and fallen into the water below, making it impossible for you to
cross.  You walk out as far as you can go and look down; below you is where the
river and lake meet.  It is a magnificent view here, and would you like to stay
and enjoy it; however, the rest of the arch could crumble at any moment.

Overlooking the Lake~
You stand on a cliff overlooking Sapphire Lake.  The cliff is perfectly
vertical, making it impossible to climb down it.  The forest surrounds the lake
and cliffs.  The lake is an incredible sight from where you stand; the deep
blue water shimmers brilliantly.  You step toward the edge of the cliff, but as
you do some of it crumbles and falls.  You decide to stay away from there.

You are inside a forest full of soaring trees, fragrant flowers, and abundant
berry bushes--the Forest of Acacia.  The trees have grown up in clumps in 
certain places, rows in others, while still other areas seem to be without
trees at all.  These unusual arrangements make natural paths throughout the
forest, preventing you from going in certain directions.  You look carefully
to see which ways the forest has allowed you to travel in this area.

Surrounded by Mist~
This section of forest is certainly special, you realize, because there is a
strange mist enveloping you.  The mist is so thick that you can barely see.
You feel around with your hands to get a better idea of where you are, and
don't come up with much.  There aren't any trees here; this must be a meadow,
but you don't think that's right, either.  Instead of grass, there is moss
beneath your feet.  You can't decide whether you should stay or leave. 
   An odd, swirling mist is here, dancing around you.

odd swirling swirl mist~
Surrounding you is this rather strange mist.  It seems to be almost alive, yet,
it is not.  It dances around you almost happily, and successfully prevents you
from seeing more than three feet in any direction.  Looking closely at the
mist, you see tiny sparkles; they twinkle as if to say hello.  Truly magical.

Surrounded by Mist~
This section of forest is certainly special, you realize, because there is a
strange mist enveloping you.  The mist is so thick that you can barely see.
You feel around with your hands to get a better idea of where you are, and
don't come up with much.  There aren't any trees here; this must be a meadow,
but you don't think that's right, either.  Instead of grass, there is moss
beneath your feet.  You can't decide whether you should stay or leave. 
   An odd, swirling mist is here, dancing around you.

odd swirling swirl mist~
Surrounding you is this rather strange mist.  It seems to be almost alive, yet,
it is not.  It dances around you almost happily, and successfully prevents you
from seeing more than three feet in any direction.  Looking closely at the
mist, you see tiny sparkles; they twinkle as if to say hello.  Truly magical.

In the Forest of Acacia~
You are inside a forest full of soaring trees, fragrant flowers, and abundant
berry bushes--the Forest of Acacia.  The trees have grown up in clumps in
certain places, rows in others, while still other areas seem to be without
trees at all.  These unusual arrangements make natural paths throughout the
forest, preventing you from going in certain directions.  You look carefully
to see which ways the forest has allowed you to travel in this area.

Climbing the Great Oak~
You are climbling the Greak Oak, gingerly keeping your hands and feet in the
small notches on the tree's east side.  The drop to the bottom is a long one;
you must be extra careful.  Looking to each side of you, you have a magnificent
view of the forest.  It must look far more grand from the top of the tree.  You
decide continue climbling to see for yourself.

You stand inside a large cave inside the Great Oak.  The cave appears to be
carved out, but the walls look and feel like white marble.  How is this
possible if you are inside a tree?  The cave is bathed in a blinding white
light which seems to permeate through the walls, yet there are no visible
cracks capable of bringing the light through.  Could it be that the walls are
glowing bright enough to light the room?  Or could it be some unseen presence?

it is more wonderful than anything you could have imagined.  The large leaves
of the tree provide shade for you, and a comfortable place for you to sit down

that she is in charge, and plans any pranks the trio do.

A large white unicorn grazes here, it's horn shining brilliantly.

Before you stands a mythical unicorn.  Except, it isn't quite a myth anymore,
because the unicorn is here before your very eyes.  It is a docile creature,
allowing you to walk up to it and pet it's mane.  You could even mount the 
beautiful creature.  The unicorn is a silvery-white, with a silky mane and
tail.  Adorning it's head is a large, golden horn.  Be wary of this horn, for 
it is sharp enough to cause major harm to you.

that he has traveled all this way to visit the Great Oak, or speak to the
