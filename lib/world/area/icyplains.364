Before the Icy Plains~
You stand before the icy plains of the north. Ahead of you lies the
cold, icy landscape of a land few men have ever stepped upon and lived.
The area is a pure white landscape of ice and snow. All you can see
in all directions is more ice and more snow.

Icy Plains of the North~
Walking out onto these icy plains you find yourself surrounded by
the white expenses of this cold, frigid environment. To the east
lies a large mountain range, to the west your view is blocked by
the swirls of a snowstorm. The plains drift on to the north.

Icy Plains of the North~
You wander upon a bed of ice and snow. Everything around is covered
in a thick layer of snow on top of an even thicker layer of ice. A
flat plain of ice extends to your north. To the west a blur of snow
indicates that the snow is building up in that direction. To the east
you can make out the tip of a large layer of mountains.

Icy Plains of the North~
You walk through the cold, icy northern plains. At this point in the
plains the wind has started to pick up and a thin string of snow begins
to fly in your face. The snowstorm seems to worsen to your west. To the
east it eases up slightly.

Icy Plains of the North~
At this point in the plains a thick hail of snow begins to pelt your
ever-more freezing body. The snow begins to build on top of your feet
as you try to walk, making the journey difficult. To the east the storm
abates slightly. To the west the storm appears to strengthen.

Wandering Through An Intense Snowstorm~
Standing in whirlwind of snow and ice, you begin to rethink your
idea to explore this area. Vast amounts of snow whirl and fly
into your face, nearly blinding you. Crystals of ice hail down
upon you with a vicious ferocity. You can see nothing but the
torment of snow and ice in all directions.

Wandering Through An Intense Snowstorm~
You blaze onward through an intense barrage of ice and snow. The ice
crystals pelt you through your armor and have begun to form small
welts about your body. The snow and wind freezes you to the core.
You can barely feel parts of you body. All around is the white of
snow and ice.

The intense assault of snow and ice pounds down upon you as the snowstorm

the intense white whirlwind of the storm. You are almost blinded by
the sheer power and ferocity of the storm.

Wandering Through An Intense Snowstorm~
The ferocious storm continues to circulate and build up strength and
power as you travel through it. The thick white blanket of snow covering
the ground impedes your movement as you try to move your legs. With every
step the journey gets more and more difficult. You don't know how much
longer you can take this.

Wandering Through An Intense Snowstorm~
Holding your cloak tight around your body you proceed through a thick
white wall of cascading snow and ice. The weight and force of the storm
weighs so heavily upon your back that you feel as if you are in snowslide.
You body is now covered in welts from the ice and you can no longer feel
the majority of your body parts. How you long for a warm fire and a nice
meal. You don't think you can survive in this much longer.

Wandering Through An Intense Snowstorm~
The pounding of the storm has begun to take its toll on you. Your feet
are now completely numb and you can barely lift them out of the snow.
You exposed skin has turned a pale blue, indicating you have very little
time left to escape this nightmare. You begin to dream back upon better
times and almost pass out form the cold. But out of the corner of your
eye, you feel a faint glimmer of hope. A thin blue object shines faintly
to your east, but as you look at it, it is now to the north! Now to the
south! You suddenly realize you are hopelessly delusional, but you gain
strength from knowing somewhere nearby there is shelter, and hope.

Wandering Through An Intense Snowstorm~
You quickly brush a large pile of snow off your back that threatened
to bring to the ground from its large weight. Ice has begun to form
around your nose and mouth. Trying to utter a word to remind you that
you are alive, you realize your mouth was nearly frozen shut! Suddenly
you come to be aware that if you don't leave this hideous entrapment you
will soon become a frozen landmark in its unforgiving vastness, soon to
be covered in snow and ice and forgotten like all else that happened to
wander into this foul area.

Before a Castle of Ice~
You stumble slightly from exhaustion and from the weight of the
snow that has accumulated upon your body. Lying in the snow you
contemplate whether you should get up or lie there and die. Finding
some unknown source of energy you struggle and decide to forge forward.
As you look forward you see you made the right choice. Standing to your
north is a large blue castle, made entirely of ice! You gaze at it in
amazement for a short moment then realize you must move on or perish
in the storm.

The Gates of the Ice Castle~
You stand within a set of large gates guarding the entrance to the
ice castle. The gates don't seem to serve much of a purpose though,
since they appear to be frozen to the wall. Evidently whoever lives
in this castle isn't too concerned about keeping people out. The
hallway runs towards the north.

Hallway in the Ice Castle~
This is a large hallway, constructed entirely of ice. The ceiling
here is over nine feet tall and constructed of a bright blue ice
that dazzles your eyes. The entire castle is constructed of the
same bright blue ice. You wonder to yourself what could live here.

Hallway in the Ice Castle~
You walk down a long hallway constructed of bright blue ice. The
ceiling towers high over your head. The width of the hallway here
spans nearly 20 feet in length! Whoever built this castle seems to
have cared considerably about comfort and size. You can make out
the gates of the castle back south.

hallway continues on to the north, where you can hear a faint clicking
sound and some grunting.

Hallway in the Ice Castle~
You proceed down a large ice hallway through the castle of ice. All
around you is thick, blue ice. The hallway is completely unmarked
the walls do not contain a single scrape or hole. To your south you
can see an intersection with a smaller hallway. A short distance to
your north you can spot a large door. You can also hear some grunts
and scrapings in that direction. There is something up there.

This is a large hallway of ice. At this point in the hallway two large
columns stand in the center of the hallway, lending their weight to
the ceiling. They are also made of ice. To the north you can see the
front of a very large door. The audible sounds of grunting and scraping
have become louder also.

You now come to stand before a huge door leading to what appears
to be a very large room beyond it. The sounds of grunting and what
sounds like stomping can be heard very clearly now. The door is a
large two-sided door, made entirely of ice of course. It looks very
heavy but you think you can push it open if you try hard enough.

It is pitch black in here. An odd blackness. Unlike the night, which

darkness, as if there were a torch that shined blackness. You can

The Queen's Room~
This room is simply exquisite compared to the rest of these
dreary tunnels. In the center of the room is a huge bed complete
with bright purple sheets and huge golden pillows. Thin silk
drapes hang on all sides of the room. Several servants stand
around, catering to the wishes of their master, the queen of
the Gt'Mocks.

Walking into this room your are awarded to a completely sickening

children, but what is really sickening is what they are doing. The
gt'mock children are crawling on the floor, a sick mass of half grown
fur and a slimy coat, chewing on the dead body's of humans!

by the children. The bones of the dead men are being ground up and
forged into all manner of goods. Several skins hang from the walls.

Standing aboard this ship you feel a sickening urge to throw
up. The entire ship seems to be made entirely of a thin, bright
green mist. The mist forms every part of the ship. It gives off
a hazy glow that chills you to the bone. What's even more
disheartening is the aura of the ship. Somehow it just doesn't
FEEL right. Something is wrong with this place.

You stand, looking over the starboard side of a ghostly

green mist that make up this ship dance a delicate storyline.
On the water it appears as if the mist is trying to recreate
a tragic scene. In your imagination you begin to think you
can see pictures of a bloody battle on the seas. A valiant
prince and his crew are fighting bravely against a fleet of
evil monsters. The captain appears to be winning the fight but
a human mage appears before the monsters and uses dark magic
to strike a fatal blow to the prince's army. At least that's
what you imagine is happening. It's all just in your head.
