plaque~
The stars above you are only saw on top of Mount Cortius. Each one
was given a great meaning to hold within it as long as it shine bright.
It is that the stars have never dimmed because of the meaning each
one holds. Other tiny stars surround them to protect them from any
harm towards them. This the star circle of Elatinus, and within it
it holds the power of no other creation of its kind.
