Iron Gates of the Great Altonian Academy~
Before you stands a gigantic academy, world renoun for instructing
the greatest warriors and most powerful magicians. It is my job now
to bring on the instruction of another and teach you in the wise and
sometimes down-right difficult ways of Altanos. To start with, if you
will take a close inspection of the 'LOOK' command, you will notice
a compass-like ascii drawing. This is for easy navigation. If you see
an abbreviation for a letter in yellow, you can walk that way. For an
example, if you saw a U on it, you could walk up.
 
Proceed to the north to continue your training.

Basic Movement through Doors~
To navigate through Altanos can be confusing, as other of todays
multi-user dungeons use something that appears as [Exits: or something
of that nature. If you want to see the rooms exits in your prompt and
or do not like the compass, you can type 'SETTINGS PROMPTEXITS' and
you will see something similar to &c[ n d e ]&O on your prompt, which
if you are new to MUDs in particular, usually displays life, stamina
and spell power(commonly referred to as mana). Now, sometimes you will
encounter doors, these have to be opened before traversed through, unless
you have the use of a magical spell to walk through them. To open a door,
type 'OPEN <DIRECTION or DOOR KEYWORD>'. For an example, there has been a
door built in this room for the example of teaching. To open this door, type
the following command: 'OPEN NORTH'. Once you have done this, the door will
be open and you can continue navigation through the academy.

Object Interaction~
In the Lands of Altanos, there will be a time that you want to 
pick up an object, utilize it, or drop it, etc. To pick up an item,
type 'GET <OBJECT>' and to drop the item, type 'DROP <OBJECT>' and
it will clatter to the floor. To utilize an object you already have
picked up, type 'WEAR <OBJECT>', or if it is a weapon, type '<WIELD
OBJECT>' and you will begin using it as a weapon. Here, some objects
may seem odd, or a waste to find, but they probably have some double
and secret purpose. Using our advanced scripting language, we have
added many secrets, puzzles, riddles, etc for you to solve, unlock
and learn from for the next hard puzzle to come along.

Communication and Conversation~
In the Lands of Altanos, it may be beneficial to speak with the
local peoples, or non-player characters as well. It is most common
to hear players discussing on the OOC or IC channels of the game,
these are global as of now, and you can use them by typing the name
of the channel followed by the message, for example, typing OOC HI
would send the whole mud an ooc from you saying hi in capital letters,
and so and so forth. Due to some recent abuse, you must attain level
two before you use any channel except pray, which is to talk to the
immortals currently on for an emergency only message. If you cannot
tolerate that rule, your channels will be removed. Here, there will be
no discussion of other multi-user games on public channels. Yes, we 
have a clue they exist, but we spend good time trying to build a base
of players, not to need someone spamming the address of some other odd
and unique game. Proceed down the corridor to the north to continue
your training for the Lands of Altanos.

Traversing the Wilderness~
Outside of cities and areas, is something unlike on any MUD of the
day. There is a massive four million room wilderness. This is shown
in the form of a map. This map is made up of ascii characters and
can be distinguished also by color, though sometimes diffrent colors
are used for the same purpose. To see a legend of the various letters
used as symbols on the map, type 'HELP OVERWORLD'. While traversing in
the wilderness, it is a good idea to keep an eye on the weather. By
typing 'WEATHER', you can see nearby weather systems forming and even
moving around, changing patterns and dispursing. The weather command is
more like the wilderness then a text display. For a legend of the various
weather systems on the wilderness, type 'HELP WEATHER'. When you are
ready to continue, proceed down the corridor further. One last comment,
when you type weather here, you will see a field of space. This is because
the academy is a magical structure floating through space, and on the real
Lands of Altanos, you will infact see the surrounding area.

Locked Doors and Passageways~
There are many a locked door in the Lands of Altanos, to continue
past these, you will either need a key, reasonable force, or a good
magical spell to break or disconnect the lock on the door. In the
room, there lie a key on the floor that can be used to unlock that
door up ahead. Beyond it, you will receive some more equipment for
your patience, and begin the training of combat. To get the key on
the floor, consult the room on object interaction before you and then
unlock the door to the north by typing 'UNLOCK <DIRECTION>'. When
this is done, you can 'OPEN <DIRECTION>' and proceed down the hallway
for your next lessons and learnings in Altanos.

The Art of War and Combat~
To survive in the Lands of Altanos, it is undoubted you will at
one time, have to engage in combat with some other form of life. To
do this, you will need a considerabley more powerful weapon then
the person or NPC you wish to enter combat with. Also, it is good
strategy to have quality armor equipped for the battles. If you are
to ask the knight for some armor, he will probably give you some. As
for its quality, it lasted the knight in battle, it should do you
well for the next while. When you have received this armor, proceed
north for more combat instruction.

Entering the Heat of Combat~
The actual battle can be harder then preparing for it, you have to
flow with a round-based combat/experience system. As you hit and do
damage, you gain your experience. At the end, you may gain a small
bonus, but that is not where it counts. The system is based on the
concept of realistic learning. For example, while you fight, new
and more effective combat strategies(aka experience) are learned. At
the end, you might reminiesce for a second and learn how to improve
your combat techniques, but that would have little effect. To learn
your proficiencies, then head into the heart of battle, continue into
your lessons to the north. You have progressed well so far.

Profiencies-- your skills and spells.~
In the Lands of Altanos, we use a unique skill/spell system called
proficiencies. This is exactly that, your proficiency in the skill and
spell you are learning/using. To see a list of what you currently
know, type 'PROFICIENCIES' without any further arguments. This will
display all proficiencies for your class, also with what level you can
learn them at. Also, there is an NPC here which will teach you the
proficiencies you already know. If you wish to continue after learning
the proficiencies taught here, progress north. If you wish to improve
in a specific proficiency, type PRACTICE <PROFICIENCY>. This will cost
practice sessions, which are gained through leveling, another part of
combat here in the Lands of Altanos.

Experience Gain and Leveling~
Experience gain is a very important part of Altanos, you gain
experience on a per round basis. To see how much experience you
require to jump to the next level, type 'EXPERIENCE'. When this
list shows you how much you need to level, you can use that for
a determiner of what to kill, etc. More NPCs in your level set
will give more experience. It is considered a crime to kill NPCs
less then half your level, and guards will come and attack you
and if it is worse, summon a wizard to cast blinding and paraly-
type spells on you. This can be difficult.

Portals and Magical Gateways~
Portals and magical gateways are the most common way of far-travel
in Altanos, some being short range, and some portals even going as
far as one of the three worlds of Altanos! The portals can sometimes
damage you on the way through, and they have been known to destroy
the player and all his/her equipment from time to time, but only on
the larger scale interplanetary portals. These are a useful, though
sometimes sacrificeful way to travel in Altanos. To enter a portal,
type simply 'ENTER' or if there are more then one, 'ENTER <KEYWORD>'

Standing above the Combat Practice Area~
Down below lies a combat arena, your ultimate challenge in this
academy. You must succesfully defeat the master trainer of the arena
to pass into the world. To get stronger, we have setup a series of
weaker enemies for you to engage in combat before you take on the
master. If you can defeat the master, you will receive a bonus and
the way to a portal to Daevenshire.

In the Midst of the Combat Practice Arena~
You seem to be located within some massive practice area, you can
hear the sounds of victory (and loss, though not as pleasant) coming
from various others within the arena. Another sub-frequent noise is
the hum of the energy portal opening and closing, sending new and
old adventurers alike into the arena to learn and fight.

Before a Massive Controlled Energy Portal~
You stand before a massive portal, probably one of the largest
in the world, controlled magically as not to harm you. You can
see visions of a nearby city in its depths, floating around to
show the many things that make up Daevenshire. To reach this point
is a great wonder, as few have. The room itself seems to be made of
some mysterious green tile that is easy on the eye, as well. This
may be to dispel some of the effects from the huge light of the
portal that is blinding to look at-- even through the most tuned eye.

You seem to be located within some massive practice area, you can
hear the sounds of victory (and loss, though not as pleasant) coming
from various others within the arena. Another sub-frequent noise is
the hum of the energy portal opening and closing, sending new and
