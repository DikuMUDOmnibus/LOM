The Port Of Zedd Town~
   You stare in astonishment at the size of Zedd Town...
After examining the sky for a few minutes, you realize an old sailor has 
been staring at you the whole time. 
When you finally decide to speak, the sailor points to the city and says
"Hi stranger, You must be new here..... enjoy your stay in Zedd town" 
You turn to look back at the sailor and notice he is no longer there!
A feeling of hope and uneasiness pervades your body as you think about the
city of Zedd Town!

Inside The WarDome~
   The inside of the arena offers a dramatic contrast.  Like
the exterior, the stands offer the most luxurious accommodations for
the spectators.  The field however, is a battleground composed of corpses, mud,
turf and rock surrounded by an 8-foot high stone wall.  There are two
entrances to the killing field--as audience participation is welcomed,
though not strongly recommended.
   To the east are the Blue Seats, to the north are the West Stands.
Going west, you exit the arena.

to the East Stands of WarDome -- the SuperBoxes.  Unfortunately,
you are not permitted to go in as these are reserved for the very
elite.  There is a sign on the door to the SuperBoxes. 
   After getting over your disappointment (you always wanted to
see the inside of a SuperBox), you notice that someone has rather
carelessly left open the door to the Visitor's War room, just
inviting someone to walk in.
   The concourse runs west, to the north you may enter the war-

   You are standing in the cavernous lobby of the Museum.
During your examination of the lobby, you are startled by the 
museum curator.  The curator whines to you about how the museum is still 
under renovations and how the lack of funds from the city is slowing the 
the museum's progress.  After a long and boring story, you jump at the 
chance to make a polite exit and quickly make your departure.
   Grubby Street is to the west.

The Lobby Of The Inn~
   This is one of the most luxurious Inns you have ever seen. It 
makes the inn at Midgaard look rather pathetic.  Pillars of gold
tower above you to both your left and right.  You try to chip a piece
off the towers, but you think twice when you see the large guards who
would readily bite your head off if you even thought about trying.
   To the east is Grubby Street.  Follow the stairs up to check in at the

%s Terribly sorry, I don't have one of those, but I have a poem about one.  Would you like to hear it?~
%s Don't you know Goethe knows all?  Sell me something you have.~
%s Get a clue!  Try the store next door.  Non-poets can't stand them.~
%s I've spent all my money to feed all the hungry artists in the world.  I can't afford that.~
%s Sorry, you can't afford that, but you can afford a copy of 'Goethe: the poet's early years' (autographed version).~
%s That will cost you %d coins.  And with that fine purchase you recieve a free copy of 'Goethe: Mere Genius or God.'~
%s Money is but transient ether.  I will buy it for %d coins.~
