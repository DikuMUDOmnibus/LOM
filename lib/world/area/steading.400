Standing Before the Steading~
At this point the path ends abruptly, before the great oaken portals
that herald the entrance to the Steading, presumed lair of the fecund
hill giants. The source of the raiding parties that have been lately
befouling this region is at hand; it is with grim determination that
you tighten your grip on your weapon and prepare to put an end to 
their reign of terror. Gazing upwards, you see the great doors merge 
into the wooden walls of the steading, towering high overhead. Such a
large structure must surely contain several dozen giants, but despite
the risks, onwards you must press!

A Spacious Cloak Room~
Stretching along the southern wall of the great hallway you pass into
is a coat rack, from which depend dozens of cloaks, furs, capes and
large satchels, containing the worthless junk accumulated by these
brutish giants in their travels. Any items of worth are doubtless by
now sequestered elsewhere; a search here would be pointless. The wall
to the north is lined with doors, three to be precise, spaced evenly
along the wall as it heads west. Peering into the gloom, you see only
sporadic lighting, cast by sputtering tar-soaked switches.

A Spacious Cloak Room~
The hallway continues, dominated at this point by another set of doors,
equal in size and majesty to those that barred entrance to this place.
A great deal of noise issues from behind this portal, which may or may
not be an incentive to proceed in this direction. The air is warm, and
carries a strong odor of sweat mingled with a slight stench of decay,
emanating from several uncured hides piled here. To the west, a flight
of steps leads up into a guard tower.

The Base of a Guard Tower~
The hallway ends here, at the base of a set of stairs, that wind up
into the interior of a watch tower, doubtless a vantage point that
enables the giants to spy upon visitors to the steading. Apparently
the giants stationed within are remarkably unobservant, for no alarms
have been raised thus far since your entrance. The third of the three
doors lining the northern wall lies directly before you. A faltering
light is cast by a flickering brand affixed to the stair.

The Watch Tower~
This spacious guard post boasts two beds, a small table, and several
piles of furs and hides, used for comfort and warmth by those who are
stationed here. A large ring of iron hangs from the roof, and next to
it dangles a bar fashioned from the same- a primitive, but effective,
alarm. The heady aroma of spilt ale is strong here, and may explain
the lethargy of the guards within this tower.

A Short Corridor~
At this point a featureless corridor joins a door to the south, and a
junction to the north, each direction for the moment devoid of any
visible habitation. A single door is set into the wooden wall here, to
the west, bearing a large iron handle and a strange symbol. Evidently 
a giantish rune, only other hill giants would be able to deduce what it
symbolizes.

This large chamber is three times the size of the rooms commonly seen
in inns and taverns across the empire, but then again its inhabitant
is proportionately larger. Evidently the abode of a giant of some
importance, it boasts numerous (tacky) furnishings, including a large
four poster bed covered in thick hides and furs. Several chairs are
arranged around a table, which rests against the far wall, beneath a
large bear hide, presumably a trophy of the hunt.

A Dark Junction~
Inadequate lighting (perhaps due to fear that excessive torchlight 
poses a fire hazard) makes it difficult to see far in any direction
from this junction, though a bend in the corridor is apparent to the
west, and two doors can be seen to the south. Footsteps can be heard,
as if from nearby, though the heavy tread of a giant is audible some
distance away. Occasionally you can hear a raucous cry, coming from
somewhere to the north.

A Bend in the Corridor~
After a short distance the corridor bends, with branches disappearing
into the gloom to the north and west. A door is set in the south wall,
at the point where the two passages meet. A single torch burns low in
an iron sconce at this point, casting the only light visible within
a dozen or more yards. Cries and footsteps mingle with a loud snoring,
issued by slumbering giants.

Barracks Hall~
A total of ten large beds, piled high with hides, fill most of this
narrow hall, ample evidence of a barracks for some of the many giants
that inhabit this wooden keep. Dirty capes, smeared with grime from
days of travel, hang from hooks set in the walls, and large pairs of
muddy boots mar the floor. Several iron cressets line the walls, some
containing the smoldering stubs of torches.

A Dimly Lit Passageway~
The passage runs north, past at this point a door set in the west wall.
From behind the door issue cries and shouts of merriment, albeit with
a cruel edge to the laughter. The door is marked with another cryptic
rune, though the meaning of this one is a little more obvious- two small
giants being embraced by a larger. To strike at the young of this place
would certainly be a telling blow against the giants' morale.

Creche~
This long hall boasts a door at either end, and serves as the general
quarters of the giantish young, where they await the return of their
parents from the raids against humanity. Apparently serving as a sort
of training yard as well as playpen, the room boasts numerous make-
shift weapons mixed in with the toys. In fact, the weapons appear to
be considered toys themselves.

A Bend in the Corridor~
The corridor bends here, offering two possible destinations to those
brave enough to have penetrated this evil lair. Shouts and cries issue
at random intervals from the north, ample evidence of alert inhabitants.
It would be a change to catch the giants who live here awake; it seems
most of them spend a great deal of time in drunken stupors. The air is
thick with greasy smoke, the source of which is a smoldering brand near
your head.

The End of the Corridor~
The corridor ends abruptly, before a door set in the eastern wall,
which bears a crude marking that appears to represent giant childer.
These youths could well be the source of the hue and cry, though the
noise appears for the most part to be concentrated somewhere further
north, beyond the hide that covers the north wall.

The End of the Corridor~
At the northern end of this corridor, you are faced with two choices,
both of them wooden portals, set in the western and northern walls.
By now you estimate that you have penetrated at least halfway into the
steading, and must surely be nearing the mastermind of the dark race
that abides here. Hopefully, at any rate; the sooner you are able to
evacuate this foul structure the better; giants are poor company at 
the best of times.

This spacious chamber houses the many maids that serve the more 
important giants of the Steading, most notably the ruler and his
wife. Several beds line the walls, while two wardrobes hold the
clothing owned by those quartered here. The air is warmed by a
blazing fire in the hearth, and the air is thick with greasy smoke.
It would be fair to say that even the cleanest of hill giants appear
to prefer to live in squalor.

You pass into a spacious hall, that stretches in each direction save
the south, where it terminates in a wooden door. To the west lies a
brightly lit wing, which bends southward, and apparently houses the
belongings of a giant of importance; even from here numerous trophies
and tapestries are visible. To the west lies a large pair of double
doors, equal in dimension to those at the entrance to the Steading.
From behind them issue various sounds, including shouts, cries, moans
and belches.

Hall of the Chief~
This large hall boasts numerous features of interest. The walls and
floor are lined with rugs, hides and skins, while numerous tables and
wooden shelves labor under the weight of piles of pottery and dinner
ware. A long stone shelf above the hearth is lined with skulls, most
of them dwarven. Several stools are arranged around a table which bears
a crude map of the region; at last some evidence of the mastermind that
is behind these raids. But surely a mere hill giant would not possess
significant intelligence to orchestrate such a campaign of terror? A
large wooden door lies to the north, apparently leading to the chief's
private quarters.

large door to the south, presumably the abode of the chief's wife.
Like most of the doors in this place, it does not appear to be locked
or barred. Then again, only the most foolish would risk incurring the
wrath of the chief by trespassing. This section of the hall is but
dimly lit in comparison to the north.

what is a large bedchamber. Filled with stolen wooden furniture that
came from a dozen raids, it also boasts many stuffed footstools, rugs
and a table lined with chairs. The door to this room opens inwards,

if to keep out whatever beast is howling beyond it. A heavy ring of

event that those trapped to the north manage to escape their prison.
To the west, the passage ends almost immediately before a wooden door.

chairs, two of them much larger and placed at each end. A rough skin
map of the region hangs above the fireplace, while shelves surrounding

noise comes from this direction, evidence of a well-illuminated site
of feasting, undoubtedly by giants. Surely this is where the bulk of
the giants must presently be concentrated. A single door set in the
western wall provides an alternate route.

swords. Iron maces and hammers rest nearby, along with sheafs of long
hunting spears. The far wall is lined with shields, again giant-sized,
and thus useless to human-sized creatures, but also undesirable even
by those capable of using them due to their poor quality. A single door
lies to the north, another to the east. A thorough search may turn up a
decent weapon or two.

The corridor nears the central hall of the steading, where the bulk
of the giants spend much of their free time carousing. It is here 
that you will find the chieftain of these foul beasts, and perhaps
also the source behind their sudden uprising against the lands of 
man. The air is smoky, and carries the stench of burning flesh, as
several dwarven carcasses are roasted within the hall to the north.

Stepping into the kitchens is not unlike stepping into the most chaotic

orcish servants, who flee for their very lives. Several strapping giant
matrons supervise the food preparation, chopping and placing foodstuffs
on heavy platters, which the orcs then struggle to carry out to the
great hall. Counters covered in appropriate kitchenware fill the large
room, centred around several cooking pots, one of which you are certain
contains a boiling halfling corpse. Giant pans hang from hooks on the
walls, and several stunned orcs trip you up as you attempt to traverse
the chaotic mess.

A Narrow Corridor~
This corridor links the kitchens to the common areas, albeit it skirts
the latter rather than passing through it, meeting instead with a door
to the south that enters that region. A cacophony of noise and odors
washes in like breaking waves from the north, causing you to reel;
giants make giant-sized noises, apparently.

The Kitchens~
Stepping into the kitchens is not unlike stepping into the most chaotic
planes of the Abyss itself. Pots and pans fly about the room, along 
with carving knives and shrieked obscenities, hurled at the scurrying
orcish servants, who flee for their very lives. Several strapping giant
matrons supervise the food preparation, chopping and placing foodstuffs
on heavy platters, which the orcs then struggle to carry out to the
great hall. Counters covered in appropriate kitchenware fill the large
room, centred around several cooking pots, one of which you are certain
contains a boiling halfling corpse. Giant pans hang from hooks on the
walls, and several stunned orcs trip you up as you attempt to traverse
the chaotic mess.

This room is stacked with all manner of provisions, ranging from a

crates of other dried foods. Tuns of mead are arranged to support a
board laden with breads and cheeses. A set of stairs in the southeast

A Junction~
The corridor branches here, ending to the northwest before a door,
and continuing northeast along a shadowy passage. Shouts of pain
and anger accompany the clatter of pots and pans to the northwest,
while to the northeast you can hear sounds of revelry. Orcish slaves
can be seen scurrying back and forth to the south.

A Shadowy Passage~
The passage bends here, to the north, and to the southwest. A door is
set in the south wall, at the bend, and it is from behind this door
that loud laughter and cries of anger emanate. It sounds like ogrish
though you cannot be positive as the guttural accents of the many
fecund inhabitants of this steading are unusual. To the north, this
passage terminates before a stout wooden portal.

Quarters of the Ogres~
This cramped chamber is piled high with furs and hides, as well as
two low tables laden with cheap wine, cheese and bread. The ogrish
inhabitants are employed as scouts and servants by the giants, and
enjoy conditions that are more comfortable than their fellow orc
servants. Several large sacks hang from hooks set into the walls,
and a raging fire in the hearth warms the room comfortably. There
is a great deal of money piled near some dice on one of the tables.

This door bears no markings, and doesn't appear to be locked. However,
it does appear to be designed to withstand significant pounding from,
presumably, creatures incapable of manipulating handles. A sudden
volley of howls, from nearby but not immediately north, chills you,
and you wonder what other allies these brutish giants have.

of howls and shrieks, made by some ferocious beast. The air here is
dank and stale; the stench of soured wine lingers strongly. A slight

This small chamber is apparently the office of a giant of some small
degree of importance. A large desk (a table supported by two barrels,
actually) covers the far wall, lined by several chairs, while the
walls are lined with whips, chains and the ubiquitious cloaks, hides
and furs. Every item in this place shows signs of heavy usage, and

connecting with rock, and the sawing of wooden supports for the roof.

rubble await shifting by orcish slaves, while a wooden rack supports the
various tools used by the hardy stone giants employed by many races, not
all evil, for their excellent mining skills.

A Dark Hallway~
Progress down this empty corridor confirms your earlier suspicions-
this rubble-strewn section of the Steading is indeed deserted. A
thick layer of dust coats the rubble, evidence of past construction
that was abandoned for some reason, most probably laziness. There
is little evidence of any items of use; however a set of footprints,
elf-sized in fact, heading north indicates that at least one other
person has dared this empty hall.

A Dark Hallway~
The corridor branches here, with a second passage heading northwest,
into the darkness. To the north, the passage heads towards a set of
stairs, barely visible from here, heading upward a few feet to a
raised area, the contents of which cannot be deciphered. The tracks
in the dust eschew this route, heading instead to the northwest, the
maker of the tracks having apparently not cared whether progress he
or she made was visible to others; elves can move so as to leave no
trace of their passage if they so wish.

A Dark Hallway~
Nearing the stairs, you can hear the sound of dripping water, and
a slight, cool breeze brushes your face. No other sound can be made
out, nor is there any evidence of other occupants. Occasionally a
soft splash will echo down the corridor, its source unknown. Perhaps
this was once a source of water for the giants, abandoned when a
more convenient source was found.

The Cistern~
The steps rise to the edge of a circular, giant-made chamber, then
head down the other side into the basin of the well, which is mostly
filled with a deep pool of dark water. Water flows into the pool
through hidden, equally artificial, inlets, and the overflow from
here drains off into a shallow trench that circles the cistern, which
in turn runs off down several small holes. The air is cool, and quite
pleasant.

A Dark Hallway~
The hallway, and the tracks, terminate in this chamber, which apparently
serves as a storeroom of some sort, used to contain little-used items.
The mysterious elf apparently deposited several sacks of chisels and
hand drills, forged from a strange black metal and arranged near the
far wall, where the tracks end. Crates and containers filled with other
mining tools lie about, some covered in dust, others recently disturbed.
The bulk of the tools needed by the stone giants are carried by them; those
stored here are surplus, hence their state of disuse. A single door
lies to the north.

A Short Passage~
This passage bends to the west and south, terminating in each direction
at a stout wooden door. The door to the west bears a very strange glyph
that is nonetheless still vaguely familiar, while the door to the south
is devoid of markings. No dust or cobwebs mar this passage; it has, in
fact, been thoroughly cleaned recently.

A Storage Chamber~
This storage room is actually a wine cellar, packed to the roof with
large brown barrels and smaller black tuns of wine and spirits. Far 
too large to shift without a considerable force of laborers, they 
are all marked with a bung seal impressed with a death's head, which
may well be an indication of the strength of this alcohol. Strange
glyphs similar to those outside mark the sides. Whoever owns these
alcoholic brews, they certainly aren't giants.

This corridor, like most of those under the Steading, is for the most
part either partially or totally unlit, forcing you to move slowly
through the gloom, relying solely on your own light source, which seems
feeble in the face of this encompassing darkness. Sounds of warriors
moving about, on errands of their own or the giants' behest, echo all
around you; it will be very difficult to avoid detection for very long
in this area.

The corridor continues, devoid of doors or light fixtures, save a
couple of wooden stubs, unlit and thrust into iron cressets. The
walls are bare and unadorned by even threadbare tapestries; the 
hill giants of all giants prefer function over form, though most of
their products are crude as well as ugly to the eye.

This small chamber has been hurriedly arranged to form a crude blockade
against the southern exit; tables, chairs and other furniture have been

But who (or what) would be threatening the giants and their allies so

Several open doorways lead onto the chambers of the bugbears that
serve the giants of the Steading. There are always many of them 
here; bugbears are slothful beasts, and not prone to working for
long hours, or with any regularity. A foul smell, which includes
wine, urine and blood, assaults your nostrils.

for the most part piled high with all manner of tools and equipment.
Long benches laden with piles of iron line the walls, while numerous
forges, accompanied by large bellows, can be seen. Heavy iron hammers
dangle from hooks set in the walls, as do many whips, oddly enough. A
long wooden beam set with pairs of manacles is apparently used here to
bind slaves used as manual labor in the production of weapons.

The Armory~
This section of the armory is where the giant in charge "works"; in
fact, he spends large amounts of time lazing about and drinking, while
the dwarven slaves labor endlessly to the north. Giants, hill giants at
least, are poor smiths indeed compared to the dwarves, and as such it
makes a good deal of sense for them to use the dwarves' superior skills.
This workspace hasn't seen a lot of work; a cloth has been draped over a
bench, and several mugs of ale and some dice arranged there.

charged with their care is apparently rather dedicated, for a giant; 
numerous tasks appear to be in the process of being completed, and the
tools all look well used, and recently too. A large forge in the wall
near the entrance radiates immense waves of heat and smoke.

The hall here boasts another branch, running north towards what from
here looks like a cell block. Guards can be seen, bugbears it seems,
standing before heavy wooden doors set in the walls. The giants are
lazy creatures, relying heavily on slave labor to complete even the
most basic of tasks. Thus they expend a great deal of time and money
ensuring that these slaves are kept under control, though it seems,
judging from the turmoil to the east, that they aren't always entirely
successful.

This high-ceiling chamber is filled with all manner of the requisite

fill most of the area, along with a workbench covered with knives and
screws, branding irons and pliers. Several braziers filled with coals
complete the picture, as do numerous whips dangling from the walls. A

Orcs are vile creatures, for certain, but few creatures deserve the
fate of serving the abominable hill giants.

the south, they have become trapped here, and are biding their time
until they can make a break for it, fleeing the dungeon altogether.
The cave continues to the northwest, and in the northeast corner a

A Secret Cavern~
Dragging your soaked body up onto the shore, you gaze about at where
the river has deposited you, wondering how you are going to get back;
the current is far too strong to swim against. Bones and other debris
lie scattered all over the floor; it would seem you are far from the
first lost soul to become stranded here. A dull roar reverberates 
throughout the chamber, sounding much like a waterfall, which you now
presume must be where the stream was flowing, increasing significantly
in size and force as it travelled downwards.

A Secret Cavern~
The cavern terminates here, before a solid wall of natural stone, which
is covered in the now-familiar lichens, fungus and molds, none of which
appear to be anything other than the normal subterranean varieties. You
have heard rumors in many taverns of growths of similar nature that can
inflict great harm if inhaled, ingested or even ventured near; at least
you appear to be free from such a threat here. This still doesn't offer
a way out of here, though the collection of debris lying everywhere does
offer a way to spend the time, searching through it all.

A Dark Hallway~
This narrow hall heads towards a darkened corridor, littered with
rubble, that bends away to the northeast. No sound comes from this
direction; it is apparently a deserted section of the Steading. A
fresh spate of yelled orders from the west indicates the approach
of yet more guards, and potentially more peril.

The Top of the Hill~
You reach the top quicker than you anticipated, and find yourself
staring at the great wooden doors that bar entrance to the steading,
some thirty yards to the west. Gazing at the structure, you note that
it is quite large, stretching back for at least two hundred yards,
indicating that a large volume of giants and their dark allies may well
lair within the wooden walls. Constructed over a series of years, the
Steading has been treated with a substance that renders the wood quite
resistant to flame, and would frustrate any attempt to ignite it; a 
wise precaution indeed.

Climbing the Stair~
A stiff breeze catches at you as you warily climb the stone steps, and
more than once you slip and almost tumble back down. The steps are
worn smooth by decades of use, and you wonder how many doughty souls
before you have attempted a crusade against these foul beasts, only to
perish deep in their foul lair. Who knows what dangers may lie within
the dark wooden keep atop the hill?

Approaching the Hill~
At this point you find a set of steps cut into the side of the hill,
allowing for an easy ascent to the Steading itself, should you so
wish. Birds of prey circle far overhead, as if, having observed such
behavior before, they are expecting an imminent feast. The steps are
much larger than even a troll would need, and progress would be quite
tricky for a halfling, who would have to literally climb each one. 
This is another indication of the giantish nature of the inhabitants
of the Steading.

Base of the Hill~
The trail ends here, at the base of a small hill, atop which rests a
great wooden citadel, visible clearly even from the base, such is its
size. A chill breeze suddenly gusts along the trail, and you shiver
without realizing as you regard this place, surely the abode of a fell
tribe of hill giants. Rumors of giantish insurrection have plagued the
land for months; mayhap you have stumbled upon their source?

bugbear sleeping~
a bugbear~
A foul-smelling bugbear is sleeping off a bender.
~
Smelly, foul-tempered and cruel, bugbears are eight foot humanoids,
goblinoid in nature and almost ursine in appearance. They are a crude
race used as thugs and guards by other, more intelligent species (though
in this case the margin is slim indeed...). These bugbears appear to be
quite well-armed though, with weapons obviously of non-giant manufacture.
