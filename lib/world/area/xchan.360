The Foot of the Hellspires~
Rising before you, like the teeth of some gigantic subterranean beast,
are the jagged spires that form the range aptly known as the Hellspire
mountains. The Hellspires have claimed countless lives, along the twisted,
narrow, perilous paths that wind through its peaks. It is said that no
one is ever the same again after traversing this hostile range, whether
they survive or not. The temperature alone is said to be too extreme to
survive in for long, and is a threat to all travellers in itself. Then
there are the many unstable paths and infamous sudden avalanches to contend
with. Many evil monsters also dwell in the Hellspires, and there is little
hope of finding a safe place to hide from them in this malign environment.
Ahead, the path goes on, heading towards the base of these majestic but
malevolent mountains, which conceal more hidden threats than a dozen cities
of the south.

Passing Over the Foothills~
The path climbs swiftly, soon reaching an altitude of several score
cubits above the plains to the south. Soon it is winding northward
through the foothills of the Hellspires, a series of sloping hills
littered with bones and rubble, stretching for a short distance to
the north before merging into the snow covered peaks ahead. A shiver
runs up and down your spine, and you must needs pause to collect your
addled wits before continuing. It is almost as if the mountains themselves
were possessed of an evil intelligence, and were actively seeking to confuse
and demoralize you. A rotted wooden sign, supported by three ogre skulls,
rests near the path.

sign~
The sign reads, in barely legible common-
 
'Ware, ye careless traveller, afore ye enters the Hellspires!
Wicked they be, and full of peril! Peril, yes, and Death!
Dangerous indeed is it to traverse these parts. 
 
It is recommended that no one less than at least level 30 even think
of continuing, and those between 30 and 40 should be seriously careful.

A Difficult Ascent~
It is not long before the (in comparison) easily traversable path
merges into a steep, rubble strewn track, full of potholes and deadfalls
to snare the unwary or tired traveller. More than once you barely avoid
snapping an ankle or knee as you stumble across the obstacles. To the
north, the path slopes to the point where it is almost vertical, and you
realize it will be impossible to ascend to the higher mountain trails
without some degree of climbing skill.

A Difficult Ascent~
The path is so steep here that you are forced most of the time to
climb, scrabbling for hand- and footholds in the treacherous slopes,
cursing more than once as a seemingly stable rock comes loose in your
hand and tumbles down the slope. The temperature is quickly dropping,
and you swear it is already thrice as cold as it was a dozen paces ago.
Howls and hoots echo around the rocky path, as unknown foes move about
the snow covered slopes of the mountains that loom menacingly on all
sides. A narrow path branches northeast from here, skirting the side
of a smaller peak. It appears to be even and relatively smooth, and would
doubtlessly provide an easier trip.

Skirting a Peak~
This narrow path winds around the northern side of a smaller peak, and
is certainly easier to traverse than the other paths, being more or less
horizontal for a start helps, and there is little debris to trip you up.
A low, distant rumbling sound can be heard, however, from far away but
gradually getting louder. Perhaps this path contains other perils that
you have yet to experience? The path bends sharply eastward just ahead,
making it impossible to see very far ahead.

Avalanche!~
As you round the bend, the source of the rumbling sound becomes readily
apparent. Gazing upward in horror, you stand paralyzed, staring as
hundreds of tons of rock and ice come tumbling down the side of one of
the mountains, crashing down with tremendous force, smashing aside or
engulfing anything in its deadly path. Truly, no living creature could
ever match the power of Nature herself in sheer ferocity or capacity to
destroy without effort. It is in this awestruck state that you are slain,
crushed and buried under the rubble, yet another victim of the perilous
paths of the Hellspires.

The Higher Ground~
The path evens out, finally, after winding upwards for hundreds of
yards. It twists away northward from here, bending around a higher peak
to the northwest. Staring south, you can see for miles, across the northern
plains, and you fancy you can make out the towers of the Wall of Defiance
to the distant south, harboring the empire of Estroglia from the hordes of 
the north. Chaos abounds here, and you feel you are close to the diseased
heart of the archenemy of all things Lawful in Brythunia. Shivering, you
think you can feel someone watching you, and you swiftly spin around, noticing
then a large opening in the mountainside to the northeast.

A Sleeping Beast~
The floor of the cave that lies here is covered in bones, scraps of
clothing and hide, and broken weapons. The stench of death fills the air,
as if fresh slaughter had taken place here but recently. Twisted, mutilated
corpses lie piled near one wall, most of them showing signs of having been
partially devoured as well as mauled by massive claws. Most of the stench
appears to be concentrated in this area.

A Slippery Path~
The ground here is slick with recently fallen snow turned to slush,
making travel slow and difficult. Occasionally a gust of frigid wind
will blow down the path, which at this point is no more than a narrow
crevice between the peaks, chilling you to the bone. But for the most
part the air is still, as the mountains protect you from the brunt of
the howling winds that gust about the icy peaks.

Another Bend~
The narrow path twists and turns about frequently, but still heads
more or less in the same direction. Up ahead, it bends sharply to 
the right, disappearing around the corner, making it impossible to 
see what unknown dangers may lie ahead. A low, distant rumbling can
be heard, a sure sign of one of the many avalanches that plague 
travellers in the Hellspires. The echoing effect of the defile you
are traversing makes it impossible to determine where the avlanche
may be coming from, or, perhaps more importantly, where it may be headed.

A Bend in the Trail~
The path continues bending, twisting further to head due east, directly
into the heart of the Hellspires. You aren't certain, but you are fairly
sure that you are about halfway through the treacherous range, and for the
first time you stop to wonder what may lie on the other side. Rumors abound,
of course, most of them stating that beyond the Hellspires lies the source
of the Chaos hordes that crossed into Brythunia so many centuries ago, 
marring forever much of the once-beautiful landscape, and ravaging countless
civilizations. You wonder how many others have come this way, in search of
this place, only to find damnation or death.
 
A sudden howl cuts through your contemplation, reminding you sharply of
where you are. A cave entrance beckons to the northwest; a possible refuge,
perhaps, from the sinister inhabitants of the Hellspires?

Den of the Wolf~
It is truly one of the most conspicuous features of the Hellspires,
the fact that every nook and cranny seems to be literally infested
with a variety of threats. This cave appears to be no different; the
floor is covered in a morbid mosaic of splintered bone and dried blood,
interspersed with the occasional half-devoured corpse or pile of
decaying intestines. The smell is far from pleasant, and you do not doubt
that whatever lairs here is not far away, as some of the odiferous kills
appear to be quite recent...

A Snowstorm~
The path heads east here, skirting the peaks of the tallest mountains
in the brutal range. Travel is easier along this even, if narrow, trail,
and you are about to relax a little and rejoice in your improved fortunes
when a snowstorm suddenly whirls up literally out of nowhere, assaulting
you with stinging, blinding snow, reducing visibility (and comfort levels)
to almost nothing. Strange, twisted shapes can barely be made out in the
dizzying spectacle, and you aren't entirely unsure that you aren't surrounded
by enemies waiting for you to succumb to exhaustion so that they may feed
unmolested on your freezing remains.

An Abandoned Guard Post~
Staggering through the blizzard, you are surprised when suddenly you
see a large stone structure looming before you, seemingly appearing out
of nowhere. Eagerly, you press forwards, keen to seek shelter from this
storm, but as you grow closer you are dismayed to note that it has been
reduced to ruin, by whatever foes lurk in these mountains. You have no
idea who built it, or why, but it did them little good. A narrow path
runs north, into the blinding snowstorm.

The North Stair~
Heading north, you pass through the ruins, and arrive at a narrow stair,
carved into the stone of the mountainside, heading down to lower (and less
frigid) ground. The chill of the blizzard is causing you to ache, but this
doesn't worry you half as much as when the ache is replaced by a growing
numbness, that dulls all sensation. Aware of the dangers of frostbite, you
rub at your hands and stamp your feet, attempting to induce your sluggish
blood into increasing its flow to your chilled extremities.

The Base of the Stair~
The stairs descend sharply, quickly removing you from the brunt of the
storm. Some substance has been smeared onto the steps, to provide traction
for travellers in these wet, cold conditions. Thus the ice on them does not
hamper or endanger you. The howling, screaming wild men that cavort on the
nearby slopes might be another matter altogether though. You are fairly
certain that the steps are not of dwarven make, though you know of no other
mountain dwelling race that builds such features. Perhaps some ancient
civilization once lived here, or perhaps the local inhabitants felt the need
for it. At any rate it currently remains as much a mystery as the deserted
guard post above.

Dogleg~
At this point the narrow path doglegs to the southeast, heading out
onto a narrow path that is totally exposed to the elements, as it is
on the northern side of one of the last mountains... last mountains...
you are almost past the Hellspires! Before pressing eagerly forward, you
pause to consider how difficult the narrow path will be to navigate, 
accounting for the buffeting winds and sheets of sleet. Truly this could
be the most challenging section of the trail thus far. It is a long, long
way down yet, the jagged rocks and boulders that litter the foothills below
barely visible even without the visual hindrance caused by the snowstorms.

Treacherous Paths~
The path clings to the slope of the mountain, narrowing to the point
where you can barely walk abreast. The stone crumbles away beneath your
feet, which, compounded with the difficulty caused by ice and fierce winds,
makes travel extremely difficult. Flying is impossible, as the winds would
smash you into the mountainside, so you have to keep your feet close to the
treacherous ground. Up ahead, another staircase lies, descending to a ledge
far below.

The End? Or Just the Beginning?~
The staircase ends at a broad stone ledge, at which travellers can
pause to reflect on their travails. It is with a jubilant heart that
you realize you have made it all the way through the Hellspires. In
reflection, it really wasn't that difficult, especially the descent.
Somehow you thought that... Your thoughts are interrupted as you gaze
northward, across the broad, featureless plateau of ice, and with a
sinking heart you confirm what you already suspected; you are nowhere
near through the Hellspires; your altitude should have been a hint. You
are on a plateau in the middle of the mountains, now visible as you focus
your eyes in the distance on every side. Despair sets in, as you realize
you still have a long, long way to go.

Pillars of Perception~
Rising up on the edge of the plateau is a pair of stone corinthian columns,
covered in runes of gold and silver, rising to well over thirty feet in
height. Amazingly enough, they are not visible from more than a few feet
away, due either to an architectural trick or sorcery, or both. Between
them shimmers a magical field, within which scenes from your life race
past, glimpses and snatches from your past, present and future. You try to
concentrate, but the images are moving too swiftly to glean much from them.
The sharp odor of an electrical field hangs heavy in the frigid air, emanating
from the crackling field of energy. Occasionally the flow of images will ebb,
and at these points you see not your own history, but scenes of some huge city,
magnificent and intricately designed, buried in the midst of a jungle. You have
heard of lost cities of the ancients in the forests to the south of Brythunia,
but this one looks somehow different. Interspersed with these images are scenes
of death and destruction, and of hordes of indescribable horrors, swarming
across the city, destroying all in their paths, leaving a crippled, smoking
ruin in their ghastly wake. Staring, you suddenly stop and realize, by the 
position of the stars, that you have been staring for several hours at this
wonder. You feel a sudden urge to step through the field, but notice that a 
barely visible series of chains, bound with a massive lock, bars the way to the
ancient homeland of the builders of this artifact.

A Warm Lair~
The warmth from the blazing fire in the middle of this cavern is enough,
for a short while, to chase any thought of potential danger from your
mind, and you rush impulsively forwards towards the heat. But this lair,
as any lair in the Hellspires, is inhabited by an evil beast intent on
slaying and devouring adventurers and their ilk, and the remains of many
humanoids scattered on the floor are a testament to its proficiency in
slaughter.

Peace~
The storm abates suddenly, as you move eastward away from the guard post.
If you weren't a sane, rational being of some intelligence, you'd swear
that something stirred up the storm to dissuade from passing through the
guard post. But meterological phenomena aren't always the product of sorcery,
and sudden blizzards are not unknown hazards to mountaineers in all mountain
ranges. But most mountain ranges aren't like the Hellspires, either...

A Curious Encounter~
Following the path, you wind up at the base of one of the shorter peaks
of the Hellspires, which looms to the east like the taloned claw of some
lithic construct, seeming to tear a hole in the sky with its nail. Several
stones have been arranged here, around a campfire which burns without fuel.
Compunding this curiosity is a small tent, within which are piled a horde of
provisions, enough to feed a person for decades. Who would be insane 
enough to reside in such a place? You sense sorcery is at work, and determine
to investigate further.

Dragg's Peak~
Named by the expedition that was sent to find Dragg, they discovered
the grave of their famed hero here, buried by his companions, before
they too met their ends here. The grave has long since been disinterred
and the contents scattered, but the name remains, at least in legend.
Peering upwards, you see a large cave entrance about two thirds of the
way up the eastern slope.

Flying up the Mountain~
The winds are strong here, and it is a great risk to attempt to fly
in them. More than once a particularly fierce gust threatens to smash
you into the forbidding stone slopes of Dragg's Peak, though you manage
to concentrate enough to keep from being slain by the malignant elements.
Deep gouges mar the entrance to the cave, as if some massive beast had
clawed at them with great gusto. The stench of death issues forth from 
the dark opening, along with clouds of icy air.

Lair of the White Wyrm~
A blast of icy wind greets you as you drift inside the cave. Dangling
corpses half frozen into the ice that covers the ceiling impede your
progress, as do the piles of bones and rotting flesh, beneath which
you think you can see the glint of gold. Undoubtledly this is the lair
of a dragon, some foul wyrm of these icy wastes, a beastly creature that
is best destroyed if at all possible.

Staggering blindly through the snow, you suddenly come across a sinkhole,
twisting down into the bowels of the earth, into the heart of the
Hellspires. It is a narrow edit, but you would be able to slide down with
a little effort. Who knows what may lurk beneath the surface of the
plateau? At any rate, it is bound to be better than wandering aimlessly
in this desolate wasteland.

The Bottom of the Sinkhole~
You land with a soft thump at the bottom of the sinkhole, landing in
a pile of freshly fallen snow, which cushions your short slide down.
Your back is cold, and numbed from contact with the icy rock walls of
the sinkhole, but you note to your surprise that the temperature down
here, while still cold, is quite bearable compared to that above. A
stone corridor, built by some ancient architect milennia ago, runs
northward from here. The walls are smooth, unnaturally so, and bear no
signs or markings that might indicate who or what lairs in this underground
chamber. You surmise that this is undoubtedly one of the many ruins of
the ancients, scattered across the whole continent of Brythunia, a grim
testimony to the power of Chaos to utterly destroy anything that stands
in its way. The taint of Chaos is strong in the Hellspires, and stronger
still in this place.

A Featureless Corridor~
The corridor continues, widening slightly to a width that could easily
accomodate a patrol of guards marching eight abreast. Whoever built this
place made provisions for the movement of large volumes of people. No
banners or carpets cover wall or floor, and the ceiling is bare; there are
no signs of rafters or load bearing pillars; you wonder what engineering
trick enabled them to construct such a broad ceiling with no support other
than the walls. A flickering light shines in from the north, as of a torch
or lantern.

The Hall of the Ancients~
The corridor ends at the western end of a long, broad hallway, the
roof of which must be at least sixty feet high. This roof is supported
by pillars, majestic affairs of gold and silver, set with gems the
size of your fist (and larger). Torchlight flickers on the shiny surfaces,
creating sufficient illumination to fill most of the hall. The torches
smolder in brackets spaced evenly about the perimeter, and though they
seem to burn, there is no sign of the wood decreasing as it is burned;
some magical effect renders them perpetual sources of illumination. The
stonework of the hall is the same as that you saw earlier; similarly plain
and without decoration. There is evidence, however, in the form of tarnished
bronze rails affixed to the walls, that at one stage in the past long banners
hung on each wall. Five openings lead off of the central hall; two to the
north and south and one to the far east. Nothing is visible through any of
them, save for glimpses of a glowing chair or throne of some sort in the
eastern exit. Undoubtedly this was once the throne room of a powerful
monarch, of whatever culture or civilization once thrived here before the
coming of Chaos.

Hall of Time~
Approaching the northern wall of the hall, you notice that the walls aren't
as featureless as you initially supposed. Tiny engravings surround the
arched opening, depicting sundials, hourglasses and other devices for
measuring time. Evidently this hall was the center of all research and
learning for whatever city once lay here; some force has protected,
deliberately or otherwise, this one structure and its contents from the
devastation that rained down upon the rest of the city, and the nation,
which was destroyed so long ago that no record of its existence remains
on Brythunia. Truly, stumbling upon this place is a great historical find.

The moment you step through the entrance your senses are assaulted with
a dizzying array of sensations; visual, audial and olfactory manifestations
confuse and bedazzle you on every side. Closing your eyes, you attempt to
steady yourself and get your bearings in this maelstrom of time. Everything
in this room exists in both all times and no time at once; the effect is almost
unbearable! Images from the past, present and future rush past, a thousand
realities of a thousand worlds. Whatever experiment was being conducted here
has certainly gotten out of hand since the Chaos incursion. Fortunately even 
the powers of Chaos recognize the dangers of tampering with time itself, and
have managed to contain the anomaly in this chamber.

Hall of Discordia~
This section of the hall has been ravaged by some unknown beast. Stones
have been torn from the walls and tossed aside like scraps of paper.
The gaping holes in the wall peer out onto an inky black expanse, a void
of nullspace which surrounds this relic of a past era. The largest of 
these openings lies directly to the north, and could be entered by a
humanoid, should they wish to brave the peril of the Chaotic miasma that
ebbs and flows around the edges of this hall. Occasionally a black tendril
of energy will drift out of one the holes and brush against you; the touch
is deathly cold and leaves serious bruising where it made contact with your
flesh, though there is surprisingly little pain.

The walls, floor and ceiling of this section of the hall have been

in such a way that it is not visible from more than a few feet away. To
the south, an open doorway lies in the center of the traced outline of a
mammoth sun, a burning ball of yellowish flame that hangs in the sky amongst
the stars. You are no astronomer, but you are reasonably sure that these
skies have never enshrouded your world.

The decorative theme apparent outside persists into this small chamber,
which cleverly gives the illusion that you are hovering in a night sky,
surrounded by a carpet of blackness pin pricked with brightly shining
stars at irregular intervals. You smile at the cleverness of this illusion,
then suddenly realize you are falling, rapidly, through empty air! The stars
rush past you as you increase in speed, blurring into white streaks as you
plummet endlessly downward. There is nothing to grab ahold of, no means of
slowing your descent, and no means of escaping your endless plummet.

Hall of Order~
The walls here are of plain white dressed stone, devoid of markings or
scarrings, save for the single opening in the south wall, which opens onto
a sterile environment, a windowless room of perfect dimensions. The air here
is fresh, but still, and carries a slightly stale, musty odor, one normally
associated with old grimoires in some forgotten library, or of elderly sages
who have spent too long sitting in their tiny studies poring over ancient
arcane lore. Perhaps this was an attempt to indicate the dangers posed by
a rigidly lawful society- sterility, a stale, emotionless environment. Many
of humanity's greatest achievements arise from times of strife; in a society
totally devoted to Law many of them would never have occured.

Approaching the Throne~
As you reach the end of the hall, the whole theme of this place becomes
clear to you. The four chambers- Time, space, chaos and order, the four
elements of whatever civilization built this place, and the subject of
much investigation, the source of both their power and their weaknesses.
And seated at the end of these elements is the throne of the queen, the
balancing force in the machinations of these primal forces, the calming
and guiding force for her people through calamity as well as serenity.
Either extreme was seen as a danger, and thus a balance was sought through
careful research and neutrality in the affairs in the world. Unfortunately,
the forces of Chaos struck, unmindful of the consequences, and this ancient
and learned culture, like so many others, was struck from existence by the
ravages of Chaos and the vile minions it brought from the netherworld. Now,
only this hall remains, buried deep beneath the hostile Hellspires, as a
testament to that ancient and proud race, protected by magicks of immense
magnitude.

Throne of Ice~
A deathly chill fills the air here, caused by waves of cold radiating
from the massive throne of ice resting atop a metal platform that glistens
with moisture. Icicles hang from the ceilings, obfuscating whatever 
decorations once lay there. Broad stone pillars support the laden roof,
and they too bear a thick layer of frost. Your breath fogs as you labor
to breathe in air suddenly turned thin, as if you were at an immensely
high altitude.

A deathly silence, the silence of the grave, fills this section of the
hall, which has been shrouded in gloom by some magical enchantment. The
floor boasts literally hundreds of tiny metal plates, each bearing the
name of a noble of centuries past, indicating where his or her ashes now
lie, in small recesses set in the walls and floor. Ghostly apparations
shimmer into view at random intervals, staring soundlessly at you before
drifting back into the recesses. The air is filled with a strong, musty odor
tinged with the stench of decay and desolation. This anomaly aside, whatever
civilization that once flourished here is now well and truly gone.

though you know no creature could have survived so long without sustenance
in this subterranean prison.

Temporal Dissolution~
Stepping through the magical field, you scream as magical forces tear
at your body and soul. A whirling kaleidoscope of images assault your
senses, visible even when you attempt to close your eyes to block them
out. A low, dull humming noise, louder than you can take for very long,
hammers at your eardrums mercilessly, and blood trickles from your nose
and ears. You are certain that your death is not far away, but, surprisingly,
you do not perish. Instead, you find yourself drawn towards a small space
in the vortex of images, a black hole which is sucking you gently towards it.
A measure of willpower is required to not balk at entering an unknown and
potentially dangerous edit, but you see little other choice.

The Eye of the Temporal Storm~
The hole empties you into a black void, a cold place totally devoid
of any features, physical or otherwise, in which you drift, thankful
to be removed from the savagery of the temporal disjunction, but slightly
wary as to where you are being taken. Best you can reason, is that you
entered a zone where times converge, and for a brief instand existed in all
time-space continuums simultaneously. The effect was almost lethal, but 
you were fortunate enough to be expectorated into this place of null-time,
one of many pockets of such phenomena, where time does not exist. You are
certain that the ancients had not intended for this journey to be so
traumatic, but then, who is to say they expected people to be coming IN
instead of going out; perhaps the return journey will be more pleasant. At
least you are away from the freezing wastes of the Hellspires.

Terra Firma~
One second you are floating aimlessly in null-time, the next you are
suddenly hurtling downwards, landing with a splash in knee deep water,
in the center of a small mist-shrouded lake. Shaking your head, you
realize that you have arrived, more or less, back on the prime material
plane, albeit you aren't sure where... scratch that, the where is pretty
obvious, its the plateau in the Hellspires long ago. Its how long ago,
the when, that is the question. P'chaua spoke of a jungle surrounding
his city, which once lay on the plateau, when the majority of Brythunia
was covered in sweltering rainforest, not icy tundra. Apparently, someone
has found a way to bridge the gap in time, and to allow forces to pass back
and forth between this time and your time. Scratching your head, you try
to recall the legends of Xchantharus. Assuming it is the "city" that P'chaua
spoke of, it is somewhere in the jungle of Tinisbwana. The oldest of any
recorded cities, Xchantharus was rumored to have been decimated by volcanic
eruptions milennia ago, and buried beneath tons of ash and lava, the ruins
long since covered by the Hellspires, which erupted with the coming of Chaos.
But if Xchantharus was truly the fount of the power of Chaos, you may well
have found a way to go back in time and prevent the calamities of the 
succeeding generations from ever occuring! Confidence fills your heart, and
you gaze northwards, where the mist clears to reveal a small path leading
northward, into the jungles of Tinisbwana. It is there you must journey, and
seek out the ancient and evil city of Xchantharus, fount of Chaos and source
of all that is unlawful that troubles Brythunia!

The Jungles of Tanisbwana~
The trail passes through the mist into the sweltering heat of a tropical
jungle. Tall trees of species unfamiliar to you tower to either side,
crawling with a wide variety of plant and animal life, including clusters
of mold that release clouds of sweet smelling spores at regular intervals.
The path here is narrow, but definable, and has been traversed frequently.
A sign has been nailed to a tree near the junction ahead; you are amazed to
note that it has been placed here recently, and it is written in common!
Someone of Law has been here, and recently too; booted heels mark the ground
near the sign, which has thus far remained undisturbed by the locals, who or
whatever they may be. You have never been in a jungle like this before; it 
seems almost- prehistoric.
Three paths lead away from here, all plunging deep into the steamy jungle.

The Deep Jungle~
The narrow path winds between tall thick undergrowth, clustered closely
around the bases of unfamiliar trees. The occasional snake slithers through
the trees, ignoring you, intent on smaller prey. Monkeys howl and chitter in
the distance, accompanied by the occasional roar of a tiger or the trumpeting
of an elephant. You have never felt so... alien... before, than when you trod
this ancient trail in a world that disappeared milennia ago. Shaking your 
head, you gather your resolve and continue.

A Bend in the Path~
You have only travelled a short distance away from the lake, but you
are already soaked through with sweat, one of the many effects of the
dizzying heat of this place. Unused to such temperatures, you trip and
stumble occasionally, suffering heat exhaustion and dizzy spells. Every
few dozen yards you need to pause and catch your breath. How could any
race have ever survived, let alone flourished, in these harsh conditions?

The path widens here, ending in a small clearing offering a variety of
directions to choose from to continue. Tracks mark the trails in every
direction, dozens of pairs of bare feet having travelled in each direction
at frequent intervals. A playful monkey in the trees drops small nuts and
berries on your head; you sputter in annoyance but the mischievious primate
disappears before allowing you to retaliate. Removing your helm, you wipe
at your forehead with a sweat soaked sleeve and wonder which direction to
take.

A definite change in the air occurs as you tread along this path.
You feel several pairs of eyes on you from all sides, as if dozens of
unseen watchers glared with disapproval at your intrusion. Somewhere
in the distance you think you can hear drums beating, and you hurry your
step. Few animals lurk in this section of the jungle, it is almost as if
they purposely avoid it.

A Grim Warning~
Pushing through low hanging vines and fronds of sticky plants, you
press westward, towards the drums. Several stakes line the path, each
of them bearing the severed head of some unfortunate trespasser before
you. Snakes and insects crawl through and over the decaying heads, hissing
and clicking as they progress. Shuddering, you step away from one series
of stakes and almost back into another set; there must be dozens of them
along this narrow trail. An eerie feeling begins to overcome you, making
you feel sick from fear and nausea. There is definitely black magic at
work here, as well as the usually adverse psychological reaction severed
heads generate.

The Village of Tech'opi~
Rising up out of the jungle is a pair of wooden gates, part of a low
barricade of sticks and trees, lined with more heads, dangling from
ropes or affixed in clumps to thick stakes, like coconuts dangling from
trees. The smell is strong, a sickly sweet odor of decay, which does
not do much for your nerves. You are deep in Tech'opi territory, and your
chances of returning unscathed are slim now indeed!

The crumbling remains of some ancient stone structure (ancient even

assumed time of the evolution of humanity would be many thousands of
years older than previously thought!) lie scattered across the path,
covered with vines, moss and more patches of that strange, but 
apparently harmless, mold that you spied earlier. The odor of decay is
strong here, and you soon spot the source- several freshly killed monkeys
hang upside down from thick vines attached to nearby trees, spear wounds
evident on their prone muscular forms. Looks like you have stumbled into
someone's hunting grounds.

The path you were following ends here in a clearing, from which other
paths depend, like the scrawny limbs of some plant covered beast. Blood
stains carpet the dirt, as do the remains of various broken spears and
cloven shields. Some sort of tribal battle took place here, recently too
judging by the fresh stains. But no corpses litter the ground; they have
been removed by the victors for some unfathomable purpose.

alike, along with some corpses of beings unfamiliar to you. A strange

The earth here is marked with dozens of imprints of naked feet, running
in either direction. Leaves and twigs of overhaning branches have been
snapped off by the travellers; whoever passed this way was either in a
tremendous hurry or being deliberately careless, for it is a known fact
that the inhabitants of such remote regions can pass virtually undetected
through their natural habitat. A few blood stains mark the ground, as well
as the occasional spear or blowgun dart.

some titanic behemoth has levelled a large section of the jungle in its 
passage. Hoots and howls echo through the trees, making you feel slightly
nervous and queasy.

The Shores of a Lake~
The undergrowth is so thick here that you can barely see more than a few
feet ahead, and so it is quite a shock when you stumble past another low
hanging vine and almost tumble into the waters of a small, but deep, lake!
The waters stretch away to the north, winding around the base of a massive
spear of rock that arises from the waters due north. Unclimbable from this
side, it appears to be wide enough that at some point there may be level
ground somewhere atop it. You have heard of volcanic islands of this type
in the Ocean of Dreams; many are rumored to hold fabulous treasures, as
well as horrid foes.

you gaze idly at the massive pieces of wood drifting by. How did such
logs manage to end up drifting in the same spot... And why are they 
suddenly moving and opening gaping mouths full of sharp teeth?

The Far Side~
Here the waters of the lake wash up on a small beach on the northern 
shore of the island, a place where you could, if you desired, weigh
anchor and go ashore. Several canoes of unfamiliar design have been
drawn up on the shore, though there are no signs of their owners.
A narrow path can be seen winding its way up the side of the rocky
intrusion, heading to the summit.
 
The lake ends to the north, at the mouth of one of the many rivers
that feed it. Far in the distance, a great mountain rises from the
waters, similar to the one south of here except it is roughly a dozen
times larger, and not as tall. Atop it appears to be a plateau, though
you cannot make out what may lie there from here. You have a sinister
feeling, though, that it is Xchantharus...

for a short distance to the east and west. Shards of pumice litter the
ground, as well as shards of bone, and broken and burnt weapons. Warfare
is evidently a virtual epidemic in this time and place. Strange noises
can be heard, from far, far away, of monsters crying out in anger and
fear; you fancy that they are coming from the top of the island, which
can be reached via a steep path to the southeast of here.

to be here at first glance, however upon closer examination you see
a faint set of tracks leading into a clump of bushes to the northwest,
partially obscuring a gap in the cliff face, which the tracks enter.
Some humanoid actually lives on this strange island; maybe they can
be of help to you?

while cooking implements hang above the remains of a small campfire,
the utensils stained by smoke and grease. A rank odor permeates the air,

A hardy adventurer could shimmy up the crack, putting their back to one
side and walking up the other. It is a relatively short climb, but while
you were doing it you would be totally vulnerable to any creatures
that passed by, either at the base or at the summit. Seeing no other
alternative, you plan the best way to attack the climb.

Breathing hard after the short but difficult ascent, you gaze southward

For in that direction, past the cliff, is a lush valley of verdant green,
dotted with trees and streams, and absolutely teeming with wildlife. It is
incredible how they are so visible from this great distance, though you
cannot actually identify any specific species. Large birds soar high overhead
in the stormy skies that cover Tinisbwana. A sharp, crisp wind refreshes and
cools you, and you stride forth with new enthusiasm.

This is absolutely amazing. Such a wondrous vista, within an ugly
volcanic edifice of stone. The valley slopes gently on all sides,
rising to the lip of the stony peak; you cannot see other access points
than this one, though you do not doubt there would be one you are somehow
missing. The creatures roaming below are certainly large, and all appear
to be reptiles, some of them of considerable bulk. Certainly, you have never
seen such creatures, at least outside of history texts. Somewhere within
this valley, however, is hidden the Shrine of the Ancients, so you must
journey in to seek the information you need to find Xchantharus, whether
the beasts below be malevolent or benign.

The descent into the valley, while not easy, is certainly nowhere near
as difficult as the initial climb to get here. The smell of fresh green
grass reaches your nostrils; in a life of adventuring where you are 
plagued by constant odors of death, decay and other nasty aspects of life,
the smell is almost paradise. Breathing deeply, you close your eyes and
enjoy the sensation, snapping them back open when an earth-shattering roar
from nearby almost knocks you off your feet!

Peering upwards, you think you can see a nest, perched atop the outcrop.
There are enough hand and footholds to allow you to scale the edifice,
but what for? To poke around in some most-likely angry and aggressive
reptillian bird's nest, risking life and limb? Perhaps, though, the nest
contains something of value? Perhaps not. Then again, it certainly seems
safer than loitering around down here with all those raptors around...

affair which is devoid of eggs but littered with all sorts of other junk.
Being the only fliers in the valley, the pterodactyls can soar far and 
wide, collecting a variety of objects to add to their nest. You wonder
how many people have been lured here, by the thought of potential loot,
only to be slain and devoured? Not a lot, probably; not many adventurers
cross the Hellspires, brave the temporal gates, stumble through mosquito
infested jungles and scale rocky cliif walls to face off against a horde

herbivores with the strength of titans. Peaceful they may be, they could
nonetheless slay a person with an inadvertant twitch or stumble.

Amazing. And how did they manage to build it in this realm of savage
reptiles? You shake your head and push such ponderings aside; this
must be the shrine of the ancients, a rumored seat of knowledge and
learning. Perhaps inside its stony portal you will discover more about
Xchantharus.

Shrine of the Ancients~
The interior of the marble structure is silent as the proverbial tomb.
Not a single sound can be heard within; nor can any be made. The
uttering of spells is thus similarly impossible. Strong enchantments
protect this outpost of Law in a temporally displaced dimension gone
mad. The interior is bare, devoid of any trappings save a single golden
lectern, resting in the center of the polished marble floor. Upon which
rests a single tome, open to the middle. A slight glow emanates from the
lectern, illuminating most of the small chamber. You cannot see any other
entrances or exits; evidently this place was constructed solely to house
the book you see before you.

Inside the Tome~
You find yourself in the confines of a musty study, filled with books,
and dominated by a huge oak desk, behind which sits an elderly man,
glasses perched on the end of his long hooked nose, who fixes you with
a piercing stare when you enter. Without thinking, you sit down in one
of several plush chairs and prepare to listen to what he has to say.

The Deep Jungle~
The narrow path winds between tall thick undergrowth, clustered closely
around the bases of unfamiliar trees. The occasional snake slithers through
the trees, ignoring you, intent on smaller prey. Monkeys howl and chitter in
the distance, accompanied by the occasional roar of a tiger or the trumpeting
of an elephant. You have never felt so... alien... before, than when you trod
this ancient trail in a world that disappeared milennia ago. Shaking your 
head, you gather your resolve and continue.

A Recent Hunt~
The ground here is stained with dark red blood; fresh, not yet dried,
from some animal felled by hunters to be devoured in a feast. The thought
of feasts reminds you how long it has been since you had a decent meal.
Too long in grim mountain ranges and sweltering jungles is starting to
take its toll on your body and your spirit. You hope that you will soon
find the city, or at least a way home!

The trail splits here, offering a variety of directions to continue
in. Footprints mark the ground in each direction, many of them passing
from the south and heading northeast. You are certain that you are not
alone here, and more than once you think you feel someone watching you.
Not the monkeys, snakes and tigers, but someone human, intelligent and
calculating.

The ground here has been trampled flat by a variety of creatures,
ranging from tigers and monkeys to humans and even what appears to
be the tracks of an elephant. Monkeys chitter nearby, watching you
with some amusement as you ponder over the trail. You wince as you
feel a coconut strike you on the head and turn to shake your fist
at the cackling monkeys, who are cavorting in glee at the success
of their prank.

The sweltering heat and humidity are starting to take their toll,
clad as you are in encumbering adventuring gear. Occasionally you are
forced to stop and rest for a few minutes; never too long for the
ground is infested with ants that sting like killer bees. Not to mention
the poisonous snakes lurking just off the path in the thick undergrowth.

A Well Used Trail~
This trail cuts deep through the jungle, and is wide enough for a whole
war party to jog down eight or ten abreast, which presumably is why it
was created. If the Bwani have elephants, then small wonder the Tech'opi
hold them in awe as well as hatred. Elephants are a dangerous and rather
unpredictable steed; it could slay a score of warriors almost without
even meaning to.

A Large Clearing~
The path ends in a large clearing, where a fierce battle has recently
taken place. Numerous Tech'opi corpses lie scattered about the body
of a dead elephant, brought down by sheer force of numbers after a mighty
struggle. There are no Bwani corpses here; evidently the survivors
gathered their wounded and dead, and left the enemy corpses to rot. The
Tech'opi would not do such a thing; they'd take the enemy corpses and
eat them...

Fire Mountain~
Looming to the north is a small but quite active volcano; you can
feel faint waves of heat even from here, a good half a mile away.
Proceeding any further towards this mountain of fire would be foolish
and pointless. Fresh lava pours over the top, insinuating the entire
area in a thick coating of molten rock. Fortunately it is not a cinder
top, so you should be free from the risk of suffocation in large clouds
of volcanic ash. This is most likely one of the many volcanoes that
eventually obliterate Xchantharus; if you lingered long enough you might
actually be able to witness the destruction of the vile city of Chaos.

The trail is much narrower here than the broad western path, winding
its way tenuously between several looming trees covered with vines
as thick as your thighs, and the usual growths of mold. Staghorns
hang from the sides of these trees, and long tendrils of sticky vines
dangle down over the path. The air is alive with insects, and you find
every exposed inch of your flesh is quickly covered in itching bites.

A variety of paths meet here, in a small clearing, which is filled
with a layer of dead plants knee deep. Fallen from nearby trees and
deliberately gathered here, it serves some unknown purpose for the
local inhabitants. Wary that it may conceal a pit trap, you step
lightly on the layer of leaves, but nothing gives way underfoot.
Shrugging, you continue.

A Cultivated Field~
At this point the jungle has been burnt and cut back, giving way to
cultivated fields growing a variety of crops, mostly corn and wheat.
Amazing, that in such a dark, sinister land you would find such signs
of an agrarian culture, which bespeaks an organised society with 
sufficiently competent leadership to co-ordinate agricultural endeavours.
Surely this must be the home of the Bwani, the peace-loving people you 
heard resided in parts of this jungle, sworn enemies of the Tech'opi.

about on their business, content and secure in the safety of this wall
and its keen-sighted guards. Perhaps the Bwani will be able to help you

This swiftly flowing river pours from the north, from some underground
source at the base of the mountain. A chill creeps up and down your
spine as you progress, and the uneasiness is not helped by the presence
of looming trees, hanging low over the river, the vines depending from
the branches often impeding your progress. The jungle to either side
is alive with malignant creatures, and you are loathe to continue. But

You continue upstream, warily alert for any signs of danger or attack
from the vegetation to either side. The air is thick and humid, and
your clothes stick to your hot and sweaty skin, making you feel most
unpleasant. A foul odor fills the air, an unidentifiable stench that
you can barely stand. It reminds you of swamp gas, combined with the
putrescent odor of the dead. Xchantharus means, in the language of 
Tinisbwana, the City of the Dead; it appears already to have been
appropriately named.

Here your path ends, at the base of the mountain, atop which you 
surmise the city of Xchantharus to lie. The waters pour in from some
underground source, progress in that direction is impossible as the
current is too strong. There is, however, a small cave, barely visible
from here, a few feet below the murky surface, which you could with
some effort swim down to; your only other alternative is to head back,
unless you have some means of ascending the sheer cliff face of the
mountain before you.

further below the surface than you at first anticipated. Bones and 
broken weapons litter the muddy riverbed below you, as well as the
splintered remains of ships that look suspiciously Estroglian. You
leave such matters for now, however, and concentrate instead on reaching

is an anomaly in that humanity won't discover the secret of forging steel
for another five hundred years after the time you are in. Someone else

The mountain from which the Xchan runs bears the same name, as it
houses the same thing; Xchantharus, dread City of the Dead. Above 
you you can see a shimmering portal, similar to the one you passed
through in the Hellspires, though far more elaborate looking. The
walls of the cliff are of black stone flecked with silver; if someone
were brave and powerful enough they could amass a considerable fortune
mining this place. From here you can feel waves of evil radiating from
the mountain and what the plateau at its summit contains; you feel
yet again an overwhelming reluctance to continue. But what other option
is there? Retreat and return to Brythunia of the present, a coward and
a failure? Or press onwards, towards certain but glorious death, and on
the off chance you do survive, power, wealth and riches beyond your 
wildest expectations.

You fly upwards, soaring high in the air, finally reaching the summit,
which is a flat, broad plateau, several miles wide, stretching as far
as you can see. But what sorcery is this? Although you feel certain that
Xchantharus lies here, you cannot see a sign of it, or anything similar
to a city; only plain, featureless rocky ground, stretching to the north,
east and west. Only a single shimmering portal, set between massive rocky
obelisks, is present, to the north, some fifty or sixty yards away. Peering
southward, you can see far over the dense jungle, south along the Xchan
river, to the junction where you were deposited by the pillars in the 
Hellspires. Smoke rises from small settlements to the southeast and southwest
of here, the villages of the Bwani and the Tech'opi, respectively. Amazed
at the marvellous view of this tapestry of rich jungle life, you almost forget
the feeling of evil that tugs at your spirit.

This is it? After all you have been through, just another portal point,
leading to the gods know what? Bah. You are not surprised few others have
bothered persevering in the oft-disheartening search for the elusive 
portal of Xchantharus. Perhaps, though, this unlikely looking field of
energy is it? Not the entrance you expected to the notoriously opulent
city of the priest king; certainly not the entrance you expected to the
also notoriously haven of the paranoid priest king. Still, there doesn't
appear to be any other option, than to proceed through its shifting surface,
which reveals nothing of where it may lead. Shimmering chains criss cross
the surface, held together with a single lock, which bears an impression
where you could place a small symbol or other similar holy item. Perhaps that
is the means of opening it?

ziggurat lies to the south.

The Warrior Barracks~
The interior of this adobe is clean, and free of any clutter; only two rows
of sleeping pallets, seperated by wall hangings depicting the women hunting
and at war, fill the chamber, as well as a communal toilet facility at the
end of the building. Several women can often be found here, at ease between
hunts.

The ziggurat is accessed by a long stone corridor, the walls of which
bear elaborate murals and paintings of the sun and moon, both being
worshipped by a variety of peoples, including the Bwani. Battles are
also depicted, showing the Bwani women defeating tigers, evil spirits
and Tech'opi raiding parties, which constantly seek to capture and rape
Bwani hunters. The Bwani have a long and proud history, and are a good
people in an evil land. To the south the corridor widens into a room.

The Shaman~
Here Log'obi, high priest and ruler of the Bwani, has her official
offices, though she resides elsewhere with her family, in a communal
lodge like everyone else. It is here she comes to make offerings to
the sun, visible through a gaping hole in the center of what you
realize is a hollow ziggurat. Peering up, you see a blazing ball of
heat; no sun could be that close and hot, and you realize some magical
force creates this perpetual representation of the deity of the Bwani.
You feel at ease in this bare chamber, and for the first time almost begin
to relax in the strange and cruel world of Tinisbwana.

A Tunnel of Energy~
Entering the field catapults you into another whirling vortex, this
one shaped like a narrow tunnel, the sides of which whirl and twist,
making you feel nauseous as you plummet forwards, drawn by some unknown
source. Images whirl past quicker than your conscious mind can register
them, though your subconscious stores several away that are sure to give
you bad nightmares for weeks to come. The air is deathly cold, and you
find yourself fervently hoping this journey won't take much longer. 
Thinking of time, you find it hard to calculate how long you have been
in here; it seems at once like forever and no time at all. Doubtless yet
another effect of the null time the masters of Xchantharus tampered with
to create a haven for their fell capital.

A Rubble Strewn Causeway~
Xchantharus! At last! Excitement at reaching your destination almost
overwhelms your extreme surprise at the vista that lies before you.
Surrounded by a shimmering hemisphere of black energy, the city 
stretches away from you on all sides, as far as you can see. That you
expected. What you didn't expect was for the the city to be in such a
state of ruination; crumbling buildings loom to each side, many having
partially collapsed and many more already well on the way. Strange,
furtive creatures skulk silently through the ruins to either side, and
you can sense a dozen pairs of eyes on you at any one time. The smell
of death and decay is strong (this is the City of the Dead, after all);
you feel like you have stepped into the most accursed place in existence.
Evidently the Chaos that would eventually consume Xchantharus has already
been well under way, though you know that the city does not fall to this
evil presence. Rather it adapts, and in your time becomes the capital of
all that is Chaotic. But this IS the Xchantharus of your time, existing
in two realities at once through some powerful arcane magicks. Ruined it
may be, yes, but it still houses beings of great power that rule over
the hordes that beleagure Brythunia from their crumbling palaces and tombs.
Finding them will not be easy; certainly they are ancient and crafty foes,
and you do not doubt that your path will be perilous indeed.

Streets of Despair~
The rubble strewn roads of Xchantharus are littered with corpses and
broken weapons, evidence of terrible battles fought in these streets.
A combination of items, from this time period and your own, lie 
scattered everywhere; people have undoubtedly sought to overtake this
foul city for centuries. However, it may well be easier for a small 
band of people, rather than an entire army, to sneak unnoticed into the
city and wreak considerable havoc. Not to mention gather considerable
amounts of treasure...

The Southern End of Market Square~
The road merges here into the southern end of what was once the site of
a thriving market, but now bustles only with carrion and the fleeting
spirits of the dead. You doubt that Xchantharus was ever a place of
goodness, but certainly many more innocent people suffered than was at
first thought when the city succumbed to Chaos. Evidence such as this 
indicates a society not dissimilar to your own, save that this one was
swayed by the poisoned words of Chaos, and fell under its fell sway.

Market Square~
At one stage the hub of commerical activity in this city of old, it is
now only a grim reminder of what once was. When the city was known as
Tinisbwana, people from all over the old world would gather here to trade
and do business. But once the city fell under the sway of Chaos, most
of the merchants were slain or driven off, and the market was left to 
pass into a state of ruin. Smashed and broken stalls lie haphazardly 
about, as well as piles of scorched wood and torn cloth. Truly there is
nothing more tragic than the ghastly wake of Chaos.

The Northern End of Market Square~
A road leads northward, away from the markets, heading towards the
ruined remains of the city palace, which lies partially obscured by
growths of wild vegetation to the north. Strange howls and cries echo
about the ruins on all sides, and occasionally you fancy you hear cries
for help, followed by the sounds of some beast munching on still-living
flesh. Shivering, you press on, eager to strike at the heart of the dread
menace that reigns over this truly Chaotic realm.

At one stage a magnificent road lined with the statues of past kings,
this ruined street now serves only as a tragic remnant of a glorious
past. The statues have all been destroyed; torn down and cast about like
so many scraps of rubbish. Head, arms and legs of marble lie scattered
across the road in front of you, some of them larger than you, indicating
how marvellous they must have once been. The palace grounds lie north
of here, the walls of crumbling stone partially obscured with creeping
vines.

The Grand Entrance~
A small flight of stone steps leads up to a set of bronze portals,
in surprisingly good condition, closed but not obviously locked, though
they may be trapped. No windows are present in the palace; the ancients
did not possess the technology to make decent panes of glass. What little
you can see of the white stone walls is covered with faded and peeling
murals, depicting for the most part scenes of pastoral life and worship
of the elements and the kings. A narrow path runs east and west, towards
smaller entrances to the palace. Perhaps a more subtle entrance would be
in order; who knows what now sits upon the throne of the Tinisbwanan kings?

The Seat of Power~
When Xchantharus was Tinisbwana, when the name was spoken with awe and
not blind fear and hatred, when happy citizens wandered its orderly streets,
this was where it was administered from. But no more. Whatever decorations
or ornaments that once graced this spacious hall have been torn from the walls
and cast asunder. Whatever throne once housed the monarch has long since been
looted, as has any other trace of regality. What remains is a pile of cloth,
moldering and smelly, which serves as a nest for some behemoth of considerable
bulk. The glint of gold can be barely seen within the folds of cloth; perhaps
not all of value has been taken from here after all? Doors on each wall lead
to other sections of the palace.
 
A gaping hole in the ceiling allows this room's occupant access.

Grand banquets once took place here, the king lavishly entertaining
his family, friends and guests. Orgys of food, wine and sexual congress
were witnessed a thousand times or more by the crumbling stone walls,
which bear faded murals as a reminder of the times of plenty that have
long since passed. Piles of rotting corpses cover the floor; some
slaughter has taken place here recently. Perhaps the forces of Chaos
recently rounded up another batch of fleeing citizens and brought them
here to be slaughtered, or stored as food for something...?

The kitchens of the palace were once a wonder of ancient times,
apportioned with the latest in culinary tools and utensils. Now they
are simply yet another smear on the city landscape, a site of slaughter
and abandonment, a home of rats and maggots, thriving with life that
only exists on the rotting flesh of others. To the north, you can see
the palace feasting area, while a small door to the south leads outside.

In days of old, the King and his chosen friends and hangers-on would
gather here for an evening of song, dance and improvised theater. Only
the royalty and those lucky enough to be in their favour could enjoy
such luxuries as Tinisbwana possessed no formal public space for such
performances. This area, like all other areas of the palace, has fallen
into ruin.

Ripped fabric, smashed furniture and scraps of material litter the
floor here, which has deep gouges, as if from the clawed feet of various
animals. Similar marks mar the walls, and some even the ceiling. A smell,
one that brings to mind the fishmarkets of Freeport, assaults your nostrils,
and you squint your face in distaste at the noxious odor. Stepping over
some rubble, you see the lounge extends northward into a long hall, and
ends to the south at a wooden door.

The entirety of this chamber is flooded with murky brown water, from
some unknown underground source. The water rises quickly to chest height
in most parts, making it impossible to see what function this place
once served; a bathhouse perhaps, or a latrine. At any rate, it now
serves as a recreation area for some of the fecund inhabitants of the
ruins, creatures that require contact with water at regular intervals.
Doubtless they will not be impressed at being disturbed...

inhabitant of the lower level.

An Overgrown Chamber~
The roof of this wing of the palace has collapsed, leaving only open
air, and the shimmering black dome, above. The walls have become overgrown
with thick black-green vines, crawling with insects, that constrict the
stone like it was paper. The floor is littered with corpses of frogmen,
lizardmen, beetles, spiders and even some Bwani tribesmen. You are
thinking how the vines would be easy to scale when you notice several
hairy beasts doing just that.

Once an indolent's dream, this bedchamber has been cast into ruin,

armor, and the twisted, mangled remains of creatures of unidentifiable
ilk, lie scattered everywhere, victims of the inhabitant's foul temper.

and in various states of disrepair, though you can feel the eyes of the
unseen inhabitants on you as you wander here. Roads head off in each of the
cardinal directions, towards other parts of the city. Once the hub of
activity here, this derelict square is now a haven only for scavengers and
the dead.

A Horrid Lair~
The entirety of this ruined structure is littered with scorched, 
partially dissolved corpses, of both local scavengers and former
adventurers alike. The walls are similarly scarred, as is the high
arched ceiling, which is surprisingly intact. A vile odor fills the
room, one you are familiar with- the odor of death. But it is tinged
with a sharp, acrid smell, like acid or some similar chemical.

with graffiti left by scores of prisoners, none of which is legible to

numerous rats, cockroaches and spiders. Pools of dried blood can also be

The Western Route~
At one time one of the principal streets of the city, this avenue
carried citizens through the important areas of the metropolis like
the veins and arteries that bear life giving blood in your body. All
such streets met eventually in the market square to the east, the heart
of the city. But if the market square is the heart, then the palace of
the priest king was certainly the mind; and it is to this structure that
the major northern route from the market leads. But the priest king was
a religious as well as a secular leader, and the imposing temple of the
Crocodile, situated north of here, was and still is a structure of
considerable importance. It is barely visible, above the hedges of an
overgrown garden northwest of here.

The avenue bends around a once-fine home, now reduced to a pile of

there were numerous other routes to the temple, but the destruction that
has visited the city on numerous occasions has rendered all save the
one impassable, and thus you must proceed through the mist-shrouded
overgrown gardens.

Entrance to the Gardens~
The road ends here, before a pair of wrought iron gates, covered in
sickly vines and splotches of rust and mold. Peering through the bars,
you can see twisting, overgrown paths winding their way through the
gardens. Who knows what manner of creatures lurk therein, now that 
Chaos has so totally dominated this place? Strange cries echo from 
beyond the entrance, accompanied by high pitched screams and gurgling
noises. Drooling, gibbering beasts of unfathomable purpose and description
wander insanely within the twisted growths of vegetation, left to sprout
rampantly after the incursion of Chaos, and tainted with that same force.
Steeling yourself, you realize that this same foul place also harbors the
dread evil that you seek.

The second you enter the gardens, you are assaulted by a cacophony of
sounds, sights and smells, most of which were for whatever reason quite
undetectable without. Gibbering, snarling, drooling creatures stalk through
the tall corridors of vegetation, which frames your path to either side.
Your feet sink into mud which comes to your knees, and you squint cautiously
through the thick mist that has suddenly arisen, unsure of which direction
to proceed in.

At this point the dense vegetation gives way to a dusty, rubble strewn
causeway, that runs from a point to the northeast west towards a towering
stone structure, which appears to be in remarkably good condition. Slick
molds and moss grow rampantly over its surface, despite the dry conditions,
and a palpable aura of evil emanates from its black surface. It is hard
to tell from this angle, but the structure appears to resemble a mammoth
crocodile, mouth agape to admit those wishing to dare the interior of
this fell lair.

thorns torn from the vines, which entwine around the rotting remains,
draining it of all its vital fluids. A look of horror has distorted
the man's face, mouth agape in a disturbing rictus of death.

A bubbling fountain lies in the center of the clearing, surrounded by
a neatly trimmed rosebed. What sorcery is this?

The Noble Quarter~
In days of old, this once-grand boulevard ran past the finest houses of
the city, the district being the residence of the city's nobility and
their peers. Now, all that remains is a jumble of smashed and ruined
dwellings, stripped of any valuables, and left to decay. Only one building
remains untouched by Chaos- an ominous black tower rising from a walled
enclosure to the northeast. Perhaps the Priest King is not entirely 
uncontested in his power here after all...?

The ravaged streets of this district speak in volumes of the death and
destruction that has been visited here by Chaos. Shambling undead stumble
amongst the ruins, while the ever present demonkin soar high above, cackling
and keeping an eye out for easy targets to rob and devour. Some of the houses
still remain partially intact, as do the businesses that once served their
needs, such as the butchershop to the north. Preparation and serving of meat
dishes was an important event to the mostly-vegetarian Xchantharians of old,
and was a luxury enjoyed only by the wealthy. One thing to be said about Chaos;
now anyone can enjoy a meat dish, even if the meat happens to be human...

Bloody Murder~
The walls and floor of this partially-demolished shop are caked with
thick layers of dried blood and intestines, the result of the feverish
hacking that has taken place on the chopping block in the center of
the room. Multilated corpses of creatures of a dozen races hang from 
long rusted meathooks set in the ceiling, while piles of offal and guts
lie in stinking heaps around the floor. The stench is almost as bad as
the visual assault, and you fight the urge to run screaming from this

and carries the unmistakable stench of decay. A small shrine appears to
have escaped demolition to the south, for whatever reason; most likely
pure chance.

walls bear deep gouges, as of someone berserkly assaulting them with
metal items, and the floor is littered with blunt bronze swords and
daggers. Only a single piece of furniture remains- a small stool, set
in the center of the room.

The road bends sharply here, ending to the east in an insurmountable
pile of debris almost as high as the forbidding black tower to the north,
cradled behind tall walls of blackened stone surmounted by steel spikes,
upon which decayed heads are impaled. Chill, forbidding and imposing,
this dark structure is surely the residence of some being of great power
and evil, though the taint it carries is not like that of Chaos; it carries
malice, for certain, but not the sickening decay and nausea that Chaos 
has wrought on you thus far. Could there be a contestant to the power of
the priest king here?

As you near the ominous structure your curiosity becomes further aroused;
the structure before you resembles the keep an Estroglian baron, not a
home of one of the ancients. The skills and materials necessary to build 
such a place were simply not present during the age this city existed in.
But then you remember that this city exists in two times at once, and thus
it would be possible to bring techniques and materials from your time to
this space of null-time. Certainly whoever resides past the wrought iron
gates has a taste for the gothic architecture so popular amongst Estroglian
nobility, with a rather twisted, macabre touch.

blows dry leaves and scraps of cloth across the eerily quiet space.
Several abandoned wagons rest between here and the doors to the keep
to the north, from which the gleaming black tower protrudes. Doors to
the east and west lead into the stables and guard house, respectively.
It is as if no living creature has set foot in this place in centuries,
and if the guards at the gate were an indication, that is most likely
an accurate perception. Still, at every step you feel as if you were
being watched, by some hidden, curious observer.

barracks hall as his rightful residence. All the beds save one have been
used as firewood, and the walls are decorated with tapestries stolen during
raids on other worlds. A trapdoor in the roof leads up to the guard tower,
although the ladder than once accessed it has long since been torn away.

place may entertain as a habitant; an ally, perhaps, or a new enemy?
At any rate, you are certain that this place is not allied with Chaos,
but is nevertheless threatening in its own way. Perhaps you can take
advantage of the old axiom- the enemy of my enemy is my friend? Then
again, the Dwarves of Anramir say that the enemy of their enemy is most
likely also THEIR enemy...

to the north. Howls and moans echo down the hallway, and you start with
surprise and a little fear as you warily continue. The floor beneath your
feet is covered with a thick purple carpet that has certainly seen better
days (and years), and is an anomalous occurence in such an ancient city.

At this point the hall is lined with numerous portraits and landscapes,
arranged at regular intervals between long banners that hang from brass
rails set in the ceiling. The poor lighting makes it hard to judge the
dimensions of this place, but it seems to be much larger than a casual
observation of the external dimensions would indicate was possible. Bats,
hundreds of the tiny creatures, hang upside down from the ceiling, rustling
occasionally as they are disturbed by your passing, but thankfully not
irritated sufficiently to swarm. Such a horde of these creatures could kill
you inadvertently in their panic. To the north you can see the flicker of
flame.

The hall ends here, in a vaulted antechamber, which houses a single
broad staircase, marble with brass rails, ascending into the reaches
of the tower. Velvet wall hangings decorate the stone walls, which here
have been polished to a bright sheen. Your footsteps echo around the
massive chamber, surely alerting any sentinels that may guard this entrance
to their master's sanctum. Although you know Xchantharus to be a city of
evil, and you know with almost equal certainty that this tower is similar,
you still cannot help but shake the feeling that you are intruding, and
feel rather guilty about this fact, as if it were an act of immense gall
to trespass here.

A Fouled Nest~
Harpies are common in the city of the dead, and even in this tower they
have managed to set up nests, from which to terrorise the other inhabitants.
However in this case they are out of luck, as they are the weakest and 
least terrifying inhabitants of the dark tower, and thus have no recourse
but to feast on foolish adventurers who dare stray into this room, cluttered
with bones, broken furniture and half-devoured animals.

The Laboratory~
The unholy master of this domain keeps numerous servants within his
dark tower, keeping them hard at work performing various tasks, including
most notably the production of magical items. Here, his alchemist labors
long at creating elixirs to grant strength and resistance to the skeletal
warriors of the master's army, though progress has been of yet slow. The
air is thick with chemicals that burn your throat and cause your eyes to
water when you breathe them in. The sharp odor of acid is also apparent.
Long tables laden with alchemical apparatus line the greasy stone walls,
and the ceiling is covered in soot and scorch marks.

Chamber of Choices~
The stairwell reaches a landing here, off of which run four open
doorways, each framed by grinning stone gargoyles bearing black spheres
of energy; instead of providing light, these items actively suck light
from all around, making the place as dark as possible. The effect is
quite disconcerting. Peering about, you notice inhabitants in the various
chambers, save for the one that lies to the south, which houses only
inky blackness and looks rather forbidding. The stair continues upwards,
into the tower.

The Spiral Stair~
The stairs rise from the landing and spiral upwards, twisting into
the guts of the tower, heading for the top of the spire, where presumably
you will come face to face with this keep's fell despot. If the guards
you faced below were any indication, the confrontation that awaits you
is unlikely to be painless or easy. Dark shadows drift past you, of their
own accord, semi-intelligent undead slaves of the master, ignoring you
for the most part as they roam the tower.

The Spiral Stair~
Onwards and upwards continues the stair, spiraling to the top of the
tower, which surely must be reasonably close by now. The poor illumination
makes it difficult to see very far ahead or behind which, considering
what unseen horrors must lurk in a tower of the undead, is most probably
quite fortunate.

The Seat of Power~
The hall ends in a grand chamber, ornately furnished with polished wooden
chairs and tables, soft couches laden with silken cushions, intricately
woven tapestries and wall hangings, and portraits of the lord of the manor
and his ancestors. A fire blazes in a clean hearth to the east, while the
western wall is dominated by a bookshelf laden with many and varied works of
arcane lore. Stained glass windows allow one to look out over the city, 
though there is in truth little of consequence to see, save for the ruined
buildings and the ever present shimmering dome that surrounds Xchantharus.
The decor in this room is indicative of your time period, not the period of
the ancients; whoever resides here must be either from your time or have
frequent access to it.

The Top of the Stairs~
The stairs end in a long wood panelled hall that would be more common
in a manor house of your time than in the primitive stone structures of
the ancients. The cross-time existence of Xchantharus has resulted in
a merging of the two periods, however, meaning you are as likely to find
a crystal chandelier as an earthenware pot in this ancient city. Numerous
portraits of handsome, stern faced men and women line the walls; most
likely ancestors of whatever noble rules this gothic manse. Open doorways
to the east and west lead into darkened chambers, from which the stench
of death and decay wafts strongly.

The Rubble-Strewn Causeway~
Picking your away amongst the ruins and piles of debris, you head
westward towards the gaping maw of the Temple of the Crocodile, an
anthropomorphic representation of whatever deity the ancient inhabitants
of this city once worshipped. Now only Chaos holds their attention and
their libations, poured now in the blood of virgins instead of wine. You
shudder as you approach this place, almost physically repelled by the
waves of evil emanating from its slick black stone surface. Massive gems
of a type unfamiliar to you serve as the crocodile's "eyes", and they 
appear to stare down at you with an unrivalled malevolence.

Approaching the Temple~
The causeway ends here, before the gaping maw of the stone crocodile,
a massive hole over sixty feet wide between the open stone jaws. Foul
air, like the rancid breath of the reptile the structure represents,
wafts over you as you approach. Standing in the shadow of this loathsome
temple, you cannot recall another time when you have felt so threatened.
This place houses the vile master of the Chaotic scourge that has raped
your homeland for centuries, and now you are closer than ever to the chance
to put and end to it once and for all!

Steps of the Crocodile~
The steps of the temple ascend northward, along the outstretched tongue
of the mighty stone crocodile, heading up between the massive teeth into
the gaping maw, within which lights can be seen flickering in the 
distance. A chill air blows out of the maw at frequent intervals, and
you cannot shake the feeling that you are now closer than ever to your
final objective. The priest king must surely lurk somewhere within this
obscene temple of Chaos, and you must needs seek him out and destroy
him, consigning his evil to oblivion.

An Open Mouth Awaits...~
Stepping into the building, you cannot help but be a little in awe of
the skill of the architects that constructed this place, for the illusion
of stepping into the open maw of a reptillian beast is very convincing.
A faint moaning can be heard from the dark corridor to the north, which
is only sporadically lit by smoldering torches. Smoke fills the air,
almost covering the noticeable putrescent odor that emanates from all
around this place. Moving further forward, you cannot help but imagine
that the mouth is slowly closing around you, but when you glance backwards,
everything appears to be in the same position.

The Lesser Chambers~
The second you have passed into what would be the throat of this 
beast were it alive, the massive jaws slam shut behind you, the noise
echoing down the dimly lit corridor. Dust flies up from the floor, 
disturbed by your entry, and you choke and gag as you stare forwards,
suddenly very uncertain now that escape is impossible. Two small wooden
doors lie to the east and west, the only obvious decoration on the 
otherwise featureless walls.

the priests still reside here, save that their function has shifted from
clerical to militaristic; they serve as guards for this section of the

The corridor ends here, a short distance from the entrance, before a 
pair of bronze doors, which bear a series of graven glyphs and runes.
A strange thumping, like that of a beating heart, echoes from behind
the doors, increasing slightly in pace as you approach. The beat is
mirrored in each stroke by a throbbing, pulsing heart, embedded in
the metal of the doors, drawing blood it seems from red lines that criss-
cross the surface, interspersed between the runes, which you cannot
read but assume to be dire warnings!

perhaps opening the doors. But where would you find holy relics in such

The Temple of Txachamitxchual~
Only in your most horrid nightmares have you until now beheld such a
foul place as this. The atrocities are endless, it is hard to know where
to begin to quantify and describe them. Rivers of blood flow across the
floor, in channels specially carved to accomodate their passage, their
source several impaled, squirming naked men and women, staked at random
intervals around the circumference of this perfectly circular chamber.
In between them are stone pillars, to which dying humanoids are crucified,
while tiny imps feast on their exposed internal organs. A blood red altar
rests in the very center of the room, behind which the officiator of these
foul rituals stands, alone, praying in solitude to the unspoken deities of
Chaos. A pair of bronze doors lies in each of the four cardinal directions.
The ceiling is criss-crossed by a thick layer of interconnecting spiked 
black metal chains, from which various creatures hang, upside down, dead or
dying in excrutiating pain. The smell, the sight, the sounds, it is all
almost too unbearable!

The Embalming Lab~
It was here that the priest king and his chosen servants were preserved,
using the ancient secrets of embalming and mummification, to ensure their
eternal survival in undeath, for though the spirit is immortal, the flesh
that houses it is fragile indeed, and most ephemeral in its duration. So
even the priest king must needs preserve his physicial form to a certain
extent, for it is a long and complex process to find and prepare another
to house his consciousness. This lab is deserted, a thick layer of dust
covers all of the equipment; The priest king slew the scientists after he
achieved what he wanted, so that no others would know the secrets.

weeks on end before being finally allowed to perish, their souls consigned
to serve Chaos in whatever manner it desires. Special victims though,
such as lesser gods, representatives of the upper planes or beings of
great goodness, are stored here, in this bare stone cell, for special
ceremonies, for their souls are worth a million mortal ones.

line the walls, as do some of the more heavy duty items such as the rack,
the iron maiden and the iron chair. What is unusual is that only two or
three dying victims fill the equipment- it is a sad state for the foul
torturer that he gets few victims; most of the people captured do not
make it past the altar to the south.

arts, and used to have several full time alchemists working for him,
until they accidentally blew themselves up when trying to create a more
powerful variant of the legendary dwarven gunpowder, from your time.

This foul place was once a repository for the evil tomes of the dark
temple, but all such works have long since been destroyed or moved
elsewhere. Now the room is home only to a variety of molds, growths
and other substances, from which a variety of gasses and odors issue
forth. Sickly sweet at first, the smell quickly becomes overpowering,
and within seconds you are staggering into the walls, and collapsing
to the floor, attempting to draw a breath of fresh air that won't come
in the clouds of spores you are inhaling. Shortly before you die, you
notice piles of skeletons lying beneath the growths, and realize that
yours will soon join them.

Raging Energies~
The shifting corridors here are in a constant state of flux. Energy sparks
and surges from the walls on every side, confusing and misdirecting you.
You can see shapes moving about, strange creatures that inhabit this Chaotic
invocation.

A Painful End~
You stumble blindly through the shifting corridors, slowly losing
track of where you are going and what you are doing. Suddenly, you
wander around a corner and the floor disappears beneath your feet!
Staring down in horror, you see only gaping void before you, seconds
before you are swallowed up and sucked to whatever horrid place lies
below the city of the dead.

A Narrow Corridor~
The statue opens onto a short staircase, which ends here in this
narrow stone corridor, that runs west towards a room filled with sparking,
crackling fields of energy. The hair is standing up on your arms even from
here, and you are wary of proceeding further. Who knows what chaotic anomaly
this is, and what dangers it may hold?

The Hall of Fire~
One minute you are stumbling blindly through the shifting halls of
energy. The next you find yourself standing in the middle of a raging
inferno! The massive cave you are in appears to be in the heart of a
volcano; lava flows all around you, generating intense waves of heat.
Fire scorches and burns at piles of debris, left here to be disposed
of by this natural incinerator. A small tunnel heads down, past the
lava, deeper into the volcano. What creature could exist here?

A Dry Tunnel~
A natural tunnel, hollowed out by the flow of lava centuries ago,
runs east from here, heading into the dark undermountain that lies
beneath Xchantharus, the heart of the volcano that will one day erupt
and destroy the fell city. This fate has been forestalled by the 
movement of it into null time by the priest king, where it exists in
a state where no harm may befall it in the normal continuum, frozen
as it is in this time period, yet able to access others.

Gallery of Hell~
This vaulted hall once served some sort of ceremonial purpose, and
it decorated with vile scenes of death, torture and illicit sexual
pleasures. The floor is covered with dust and broken items, which would
seem to indicate that it is uninhabited. However, a high pitched wail
accompanied by a ripping, tearing sound draws your gaze upwards, where
you see a ravaged corpse hanging upside down from a large hooked metal
chain, the latest victim of whatever beast now lurks here.

Repository~
In this room all of the temple's wealth was once kept, and at one
stage this was quite a substantial amount. Now of course, this wealth
is gone, long since moved by the priest king or looted by monsters and
the occasional lucky adventurer. Empty chests and urns gather dust
in each corner, while the roof is obscured by a large tapestry that
sags in the middle, curiously left behind by the looters despite the
presence of large numbers of shiny gems embedded in the cloth. Or are
those really gems...?

Hall of the Ancients~
The walls inside the doorway of this area are covered with obscene
murals and dire warnings, painted in blood. The hall itself is dark
and musty, and reeks of decay and decandence. Six large stone sarcophagi
line the walls, each containing the remains of former priest kings of
Xchantharus. Likenesses of the former kings have been embossed on the
stone lids, which look to weight a good tonne or so each. It is silent
in here, unnaturally so, and you aren't surprised when you open your
mouth to speak and cannot hear your own voice. 
 
It is at this point that you notice one of the lids has been shoved aside,
revealing the moldering remains of one of the priest kings within.

A Choice of Perils~
Iron doors are set in the northern, eastern and western walls of the
end of this short, wide passage. Each is locked, and bears glyphs
carved in blood and fire, radiating heat and evil, as well as a fair
degree of magic. The runes are totally indecipherable, even to your
trained eye, and you cannot help but wonder if it would be such a good
idea to disturb whatever may lay behind them.

Dark Passages~
At this point the lava tunnel is met by a more regular passage of
dressed stone, heading north towards a dead end which contains three
doorways. A dimly flickering torch casts a small degree of illumination
in this section of the tunnel; you find it curious that anyone would
bother illuminating this particular stretch of passage.

Corridor of Dread~
Nameless terrors shriek at your soul, on a level undiscernable by 
mortal eyes, yet tangible and apparent all the same. You feel as if a
thousand devils were dancing 'pon your grave, instead of the proverbial
singular. Fear and dread twists your guts into tense knots, cramping 
you and eliciting strange moaning noises from your equally constricted
vocal chords. Yet the surrounds consist merely of a tunnel hollowed from
softer stone by the flow of lava, which is admittedly dark but otherwise
without distinguishing feature. Truly there is some evil force at work
here, some malevolent presence doubtlessly construed by the forces of
Chaos. The priest king is close, you suddenly realize, close and aware
of your approach...

A Change of Decor ~
The lava tunnel ends here, suddenly, at a junction, where it meets with
a northward passage that almost literally defies description. Walls of
writhing, shifting substances that bear an uncomfortable resemblance to
human flesh lie to the sides, while the floor appears to be flowing with
rivers of blood. Gore also drips from the ceiling, falling in large chunks
to the floor, where it is quickly assimilated. Shrieks and cries of pain,
faint at first but growing in intensity, echo all around you, and you realize
you are within a construct of Chaos, forged from the bodies and souls of the
damned, bound by evil magic to assume the rough dimensions of the structure
to suit the whims of their controller. You have seen such constructs before,
and are not as horrified as you would be otherwise. Few beings in the world
have the power and strength to bind Chaos to their will; the priest king is
one of those few.

The Lair of the Queen~
Hanging vilely before you, in a thick mass of webbing that fills the
chamber, is a grotesque array of dessicated corpses, members of all
nationalities represented in this macabre decoration. Grimaces of pain
and anguish contort their blood-drained features; gaping mouths serve
as homes to thousands of tiny arachnids that scramble over and through
the dried husks. The stench is almost overpowering, but nowhere near as
disconcerting as the sight of the foul entity responsible for this 
slaughter...

unfortunate victims of the presumably large arachnids that constructed these

The gaping hole opens onto a high ceilinged, dark chamber, the roof
of which is covered in thick strands of silvery webbing, similar to
spider webs, save that these webs are as thick as your forearm, or
thicker. The air is damp and musty, and uncomfortably warm. A smell,
the smell of death and decomposition, greets your revulsed nostrils,
and you balk at continuing. Several pairs of red eyes glare at you
from the depths of the caverns, though none of the inhabitants approach
the entrance to their lair.

The shifting walls are interrupted here by a gaping hole, which opens

fouler even than the vile odor of the Chaos-spawned halls, wafts into
the corridor, causing you to gag. You think you can see shapes scuttling
about in the darkness. To the north, the passage glows red as it approaches
a set of stairs, which lead to the heart of this foul lair. Do you wish
to be distracted from your goal by this potential red herring?

The walls glow red here, as if illuminated by blood red candles. The
writhing surface surges forth randomly, hands and feet protruding in
a vain attempt to grasp you, either in an attempt to haul themselves
out, or drag you in. As you recoil from one side, you almost stumble
into the groping appendages on the other side. Blood drips onto you from
corpses staked to the ceiling, slowly being absorbed into the substance
of which this disgusting place is fashioned. Some of the "corpses" are
actually still alive, despite their horrid injuries, and they moan and
shriek as indescribable agonies are visited upon their ravaged forms.

The Crypt of Txachamitxchual~
It was here, in this chamber, that the priest king Txachamitxchual was
laid to rest by his loyal worshippers, in the massive gold sarcophaus
that fills most of this chaos spawned chamber, before his resurrection by
the forces of Chaos. Writhing humanoids in various stages of dismemberment
are chained to the walls, vicious metal hooks imbedded in their flesh.
They beg to be freed, for the sake of their souls, which are slowly being
leeched by the walls to feed the needs of the priest king. Occasionally
one will let out a bloodcurdling scream as the shifting walls engulf them,
accompanied by the crunching of bones and tearing of flesh, damning their
soul to form more of the substance of which these halls are composed. Each
time this happens the sarcophagus glows slightly, as it absorbs more energy
for its owner, that when he rests here he may draw from it, invigorating
himself.

Here the priest king keeps the spoils of his many victories, though he
is far too chaotic to pay close attention to most of the valuables, and
once where there lay magnificent works of art and ornate pieces of
furniture now remain only the moldering remnants, buried beneath tons of
tarnished bronze, tattered bloodstained tapestries and piles of gleaming
coins from faraway worlds. A strong musty odor pervades this chamber, the
stench of rotting cloth and old scents and unguents. Jars of them line the
walls, which buckle and melt over them occasionally, before being jerked back
by the magic that binds the chaotic substance to maintain the throne room's
form.

The Halls of the Dead~
The walls of this hall constantly writhe and shift, as if in unbearable
agony, and occasionally a section of wall will boast a shrieking head,
which beseeches you for release before being drawn back by the magic that
eternally binds it. The floor is a constantly shifting pool of blackness,
and more than once you have to stamp your foot to convince yourself you
are not falling into the abyss you perceive to be in this direction. Gutted
corpses, still barely alive, hang from vicious iron hooks attached to long
chains that depend from the reddish ceiling, and you grimace as chunks of
flesh and dripping blood lands on or near you, to be quickly absorbed by the
shifting floor. Bloodcurdling shrieks of pure horror echo about the room, and
you aren't completely sure that one of them isn't your own...
 
A set of stairs at the end of the hall, of 7 risers, ends at a twisted
metal throne, upon which is seated the master of this domain...

The Blasted Throne of the Damned Priest King of Xchantharus~
The steps end before a massive throne of blasted metal, blackened and
scarred by magicks beyond mortal ken. Skulls, corpses and maggots have
been intrically carved into the throne, and the light the guttering torches
set in bronze sconces on the walls reflects off them gives the impression
that they are all moving; writhing in an unholy dance about the corpses of
the dead. Howls and shrieks issue forth from the damned throne, and from
the walls, which seem to be in a state of constant flux, the reddish stone
occasionally appearing to melt, and distort into the face of a screaming
humanoid. Sections of the ceiling occasionally melt away as long dangling
pseudopods of unameable materials descend to investigate the new arrivals in
the lord of this Hold of Chaos. The floor beneath your feet squirms under
the pressure of your bootheels, and you swear you can feel many thousands of
sets of tiny teeth attempting to pierce the material of the soles. The hellish
glow of the guttering torches is distracting, and casts everything in a light
that makes it quite difficult to concentrate. O what manner of being would
deign to live in such a chaos-spawned pit of entropy?

Txachamitxchual~
The mad priest king of the city of Chaos cackles with glee.
~
Evil beyond comprehension, the foul being once known as Txachamitxchual 
is now in fact a horribly corrupted lich, substaining his immortality on
the souls of others, and gladly serving the powers of Chaos in thanks for
his "blessings". Almost as powerful as the legendary lord of Chaos Choak
Niglim himself, the priest king is a diabolical fiend, a twisted, bent
decaying corpse that hobbles almost painfully about, a deceptive visage
for one who contains sufficient power to level whole civilizations. Why
he has not yet chosen to once more assault the unprepared southern kingdoms
with his foul hordes is anyone's guess; another of the unpredictable whims
of those who truly adhere to the dogma of Chaos.

fake priest king~
Txachamitxchual~
The mad priest king of the city of Chaos cackles with glee.
~
Evil beyond comprehension, the foul being once known as Txachamitxchual 
is now in fact a horribly corrupted lich, substaining his immortality on
the souls of others, and gladly serving the powers of Chaos in thanks for
his "blessings". Almost as powerful as the legendary lord of Chaos Choak
Niglim himself, the priest king is a diabolical fiend, a twisted, bent
decaying corpse that hobbles almost painfully about, a deceptive visage
for one who contains sufficient power to level whole civilizations. Why
he has not yet chosen to once more assault the unprepared southern kingdoms
with his foul hordes is anyone's guess; another of the unpredictable whims
of those who truly adhere to the dogma of Chaos.

~
Diabolic father of all Estroglian vampires, Cessephenes broods here in
his hall of evil, indignant at being ruled by the whims of the Chaotic
Priest King, but as yet incapable of resisting. A tall, handsome man
of middle years, Cessephenes is in fact quite lawful in mannerisms and
appearance; he has a cold, cruel, calculating heart, but craves law and
stability to his tyrannical regime.

toothed maw and massive spines that drip with venom, protruding over its
entire body. Evil eyes gleam with a dim, but evil, intelligence, all eight
of them staring straight ahead. It is not hard to slip past this creature,
but if it discovers you, woe betide...

Log'obi~
An elderly, but strong woman stares at you with confidence and kindness.
~
Tall, handsome and proud, the noble Bwani are the opposite of their 
ferocious Tech'opi rivals. Preferring peace to war, they hunt only for what
they need to survive, and take up arms only in defense. This is not to say
that they are incapable of fighting strongly and well; quite the opposite.
Indeed, the Tech'opi are more than a little terrified when the Bwani march
silently into battle, without making a sound, silently advancing on their
unnerved foe with weapons raised.

of mighty beasts like this that can rip a man's arms from their sockets

Pyros~
A cackling, grinning fire spirit cavorts near the volcano.
~
A malicious, mischievious spirit, Pyros looks rather fearsome, 
resembling a flaming winged, horned demon, but is actually quite weak
and cowardly for one of his ilk, and rather easy to overcome. He relies
on his appearance to frighten away the local tribesmen, who fear and
loathe him and his pyromaniacal pranks.

bwani sentry~
a Bwani sentry~
A tall man clad in bone armor stands silently before the gates.
~
Tall, handsome and proud, the noble Bwani are the opposite of their 
ferocious Tech'opi rivals. Preferring peace to war, they hunt only for what
they need to survive, and take up arms only in defense. This is not to say
that they are incapable of fighting strongly and well; quite the opposite.
Indeed, the Tech'opi are more than a little terrified when the Bwani march
silently into battle, without making a sound, silently advancing on their
unnerved foe with weapons raised.

the frost beast~
A gargantuan beast of indescribable features shambles across the plateau.
~
Once an elder god, the frost beast's mind died with the civilization
that worshipped it, and now it wanders aimlessly, unleashing its tremendous
power on any and all foolish enough to cross its lethal path. A single
blow would fell an elephant, and the magical energies that surge from
it's form at random intervals could level cities.

parchment~
The parchment contains several lines of text, containing that which
you needed to know- How to reach Xchantharus!
 
In a spidery hand, it reads - "The road to Xchantharus is long and hard,
and fraught with peril. However, if you seek the five blessed items, you
can access this fell domain, passing through the unholy portal atop
mount Xchan. The five items are scattered across the jungles, hidden in
various places; the exact location is not known, but a clue exists for
each-
First, seek you the skull of Tapax'ochoa, mightiest of the Tech'opi.
Second, seek you the girdle of wisdom, relic of the Bwani
Third, the bones of the saint Crissagorman, lost in the river of the dead.
Fourth, the krater of Pyros, at the base of the mountain of fire.
Fifth, the sigil of Orde, deity of the lost people, taken by malice.
 
These will open the gates and allow you into the realm of the priest king.
Not all five are needed to enter the city, but to access the priest king,
you will need at least two. Were that it known which two, much time would
be saved. But the very nature of Chaos that deliberately leaves such weaknesses
about also obfuscates which ones are the most effective.

exactly a holy and law abiding deity, was certainly no minion of Chaos

totem~
This tribal image depicts three heads, atop one another, all with their
faces removed and painted to resemble grinning skulls. They are of an
eagle, complete with wings, a tiger, and a dog. It is quite a forbidding
image, and doubtless is some sort of warning to strangers.

battered wooden sign~
The sign is written in a spidery script, barely legible due to water and
tree sap stains, but the gist of it is clear, and with a little effort you
manage to piece the message together to read-
 
Stranger,
        I know not who or what you are, or what master you serve, but if you
can read this then you are Estroglian, which is good. Perhaps you have been
sent by the king to search for me, perhaps you arrived here accidentally, or
perhaps you seek, like I, to lay to rest the Fount of Chaos that is buried 
somewhere in this jungle. At any rate I will share with you what little I
know of this place.
        I have found that two tribes rule this region, the wild lands outside
Tanisbwana, the tribes of Tech'opi and Bwani, one violent and aggressive, the
other peaceful and friendly. It is within the Bwani that you must seek the
information for the items you need to enter the city of Xchantharus, for it is
magically sealed somehow. This is all I know, perhaps you will find me and we
can discover more together.
        Your friend,
                    Pandus
 
Bah. Being the typical academic, he spent more time on speculation than actual
facts. He didn't even mention which direction the Bwani village lies in!

mea $n As you peer closely, the statues eyes flick open!
say Stranger, you stand witness to the devastation wrought by
say Chaos on this once fair and just city. Now all that remains
say is the corrupted taint of evil, enshrined totally in no
say one more than the Priest King. His fellness resides within
say the temple of the crocodile, beyond the gardens. I beseech
say thee- slay the beast, and lay this evil to rest.
mpe With that the statue falls silent.

book contains little information of import to most, though it would
serve as a good bludgeoning weapon in a pinch. Mages, clerics and the
