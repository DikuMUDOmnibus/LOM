3 first~
First things to do...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

- The first thing that you should do is go to the newbie school.
  It is marked (2) on the map. Type: LOOK 2 to see the map on page 2.

- This will give you some experience, gold, and equipment. You will also
  be able to learn some commands by READing the signs. 
  Then you could perhaps take a tour of Midgaard by FOLLOWing the newbie
  guide who is usually at the Temple of Midgaard (if not just wait and he'll
  come). 

- Remember if you have any questions you can always ask somebody.
  Most of the players here are both friendly and helpful.

5 professions skills levels~
Professions - Skills - Gaining Levels
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

- There are 6 player professions living in this land.
  Warrior, Mage, Cleric, Thief, Monk, and Druid...
  Each profession has it's own different skills and abbilities (type 
 'help class' to find more). 

- To gain skills you must go to your guildmaster and type: PRAC <skill>
  where <skill> is the name of the skill you want to practice.
  To get a list of skills available to you just type PRAC.
  LEARNED will show you skill you have learned. 
  HELP SKILLS for information on skills.

- Every class has it's own guild. GUILD is the place where you can find your
  guildmaster and practice. You can see on the map where your GUILD is.

* You can get further help on any of these commands by typing: HELP <command>.

4 quiting saving~
Saving Your Character - Quitting
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-  The basic command to save your character is 'SAVE'.  You should do this
   often - every time you think you gained something valuable.

-  When you want to take a break from playing, DO NOT do it by breaking
   your connection. Be sure to save first, then type 'noquit' and then 'quit'.
   It helps MUD staying stable both for you and for us.

Some Basic Commands
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Some Commands you need at the start are:
N,E,S,W,U,D    -- Type the first letter of a direction to move that way.
EQ             -- Show equipment worn.
INV            -- Inventory carried.
SCORE          -- See information on your character.
GOS <message>  -- Gossip a message that everyone can hear.
EXITS          -- Show all exits from this room.
AUTO           -- Configure automatic actions.
HELP [command] -- Gives information on any command, or by itself gives a list.

Some good help files to read when you finish with this book are: 
HELP NEW    - for more introduction.
COMMANDS    - for list of all available commands except so called socials. 
SOCIALS     - for an overview of them. Socials are commands to help you express 
emotions towards other player. Example 'smile' will tell other players in the 
same room as you that you are smiling.

It may look to you like too much to read about but we all have to pass through
this once. So take your time and inform yourself. But remember: Best way to
learn is to explore things.
