letter valaya~

10.00 PM 
I am walking along the path in Haon-Dor forest. I think only of IT. IT
is very strong and I am filled with desire to go there again. I had a lots of 
problems in my life but this is too much. The power of IT is even too strong 
for me... i just hope that Valaya will have the power to destoy it. I don't
want to think what would happend if I'm wrong.

12.00 PM
It's dark in here... I keep hear voices of druids calling me... I can
feel them near me.... they will get me... I just hope that IT wont be lost.
I'm spending my valuable time to write this in case I don't reach Midgaard.
Then, I'll hope, this letter will find it's way to Valaya's hands. Just then
I wont be sad, 'couse my life is traded for the lives of all beings....

13.00 PM
They got me!!! They are taking me to the altar. I tried but I couln't
let go of IT. IT was too strong. I don't care about my life anymore. I'll die
but they shell not have IT!!! I'll eat IT instead... I hope Valaya will save
the world when I'm gone...

eye eyes statue~
The eyes of the deamon are glowing red. You remember the stories about 
road to west and a guardian knight who had a beast pet. The description
of beast's eyes were something that your mother used to tell you when 
you were just a little kid. These eyes were the same. You can feel it's 
whispers going around your head and stabing into your mind. A strange feeling 
flooded your body... Suddenly you can see Valaya's face in your mind, and new
strength helpes you to turn your head away.

corpse~
Semi eaten corpse lies there. You can see that it's hand is in the strange
position. As you move it's hand you see inscription written with the blood 
of the victim. 

They took IT. I tried to stop them buy I was too weak. They took it away.
I hope that anyone will read this. You must stop them from taking IT to 
the Kerjim. STOP THEM!!!...."

There is a message engraved on it. It says:

How dare you to even look at this chest. Don't you known that it
carries THE most powerfull item in the world. Don't even think of 
wearing it... Only the immortals have that power. If you even look at
IT, I shell be forced to hunt you down and kill you in a cold blood.
You can't even find the key to it becouse she will not let you have it.
The keyhole is sealed by me and should not be opened by a mortal.
