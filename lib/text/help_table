"MAGIC USER" MAGE

   The User of Magic is an intelligent individual, in perpetual striving
to uncover forgotten lore and learn to channel new, more powerful
energies.  The Magic User, or Mage, channels the untapped mystical
energies of the universe through a procedure called 'casting'.

   The mysterious arcane knowledge that these persons wield is         
frightening.  At the outset, these people may not seem to present a    
challenge for a good sword or a stout club, but as their studies grow, 
they have been found to be formidable opponents.                      

Use the 'skills' command to get the list of your skills and spells.

"TAO"

Tao is the most misterious of all monks. His origin is unknown, but the
rumors say that he is the son of Snow Queen and the White Dragon. Thus he
has the power of Dragons and has the quickness of Snow Queen.
He is very thin, and has long arms and long brown hair. But, don't let his
appereance fool you, cause he is hiding the forces and powers to you
unknown and is able to kill a Black Dragon with single punch!
In Lands of Myst he is also known as the Snow King!

#
"TWISTER"

  He was met at the gate of Hades by the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
  The Keeper of the Unavenged and He did say to him: "Let you not pass
  abandon, return to the world from once you came and seek payment not
  only for thy known anguish but to vindicate the souls of the Unavenged"
  And they placed in his hands a sword made for him called: Vengeance
  forged in brimstone and tempered by the Wolf in tears of the Unavenged
  And to carry him up on his journey back to the upper world they brought
  forth their Demon horse called: Black Death a grim steed so fiercely
  might and black in colour that he could stand as one: Darkness... save
  from his burning eyes of grims and fire...
  And on that night they rode up from Hell, the pounding of his hooves
  did clap like thunder!

#

ALIAS ALIASES

An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

> alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name 
must be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be 
nested or used recursively.  Any command may be overriden by an alias 
(other than the ALIAS command itself, of course).

> alias gbb get bread bag
> alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

> alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

> alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the 
MUD's internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively. 
The variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.  For example:

> alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
> killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

> alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

> alias tr tell rasmussen $*
> tr hi there, how are you today?
You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

ANGALOT

The History of Angalot, Heroic Druid from the Rain Forest

        Many tales of brave and heroic adventurers are told in these days
of thunder. Many tales of struggle for prevail, of treason, of stealth,
murder and sinister plans; but also, stories about strong, brave, 
courageous, and wise ones, those who use the power of their arms and their
minds to ruthlessly fight against evil forces that threaten to eternally
darken the skies above and souls within.
        These tales are told among the common people, and a-many of them
is about one powerful adventurer who fights his way through the cruel
world, seeking for vengeance upon those who made him suffer. But one story
is different of all others; it is told with upper delight and with strange
glinting in the eye, as the character the tale is about is a young and
brave female.
        Once upon a time, there was a small village of gnomes who lived
their merry lives on the edge of a little forest. They were foragers,
lived peacefully and had almost no idea about the meaning of the incoming
news (which weren't many) about the threat that has started to spread
along the country.
It has happened that a troup of savage Orcs was passing near their village
while on a scouting assignment. Gnomes spotted them and, frightened by
their ugly faces, foul stench and big swords, and since they never have
seen anything like them before, thought that Orcs were on their way to
slay them.
Mothers began to run with their children in their arms and with fear in
their eyes, while males stood before the village, trembling, with wooden
clubs in their hands.
Orcs were ruthless and longed for battle, so they slaughtered the entire
village, both men and women, elders and children. Nobody had survived to
warn about the incoming enemy troops.
Actually, there was one survivor, a small baby, a girl named Rineltha.
She would have died there, alone in the forest, in the pool of blood of
her dead mother, if it wasn't for a pair of elves who were friends with
her village and lived nearby. They heard the sounds of battle, and
mourning of wounded, and silence, and they set out to see if there were
any survivors. And they found Rineltha there, at the very brink of her
life...

        Rineltha grew in a nice family, surrounded by love and in direct
contact with Nature. Her foster-parents named her "Angalot", meaning "iron
flower" in high-elven. She grew more beautiful and wise as the years
passed; when, on her 17th birthday, her parents told her everything they
knew about her. Determined as she was, she told them goodbye, as they were
afraid she will do, took a few of her belongings she thought she might use
in the cold outside world and set out to seek revenge...

ANSI COLOR

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.

> color off
This command disables all color.

> color on
This command enables colors.

You can use these color codes in your PROMPT or in your TITLE:
Color sequence starts with the & character (SHIFT+7) followed by a
color code. Color codes are given below.
                                            
Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY 
slightly. The effect is more noticable on slower connections.  Even if you 
have color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at 
all.

Color codes:

l - &l Black&0
r - &r Red&0
g - &g Green&0
y - &y Yellow &0
b - &b Blue     &0
p - &p Purple (magenta)&0
c - &c Cyan&0
w - &w White (looks grey in normal terminals, use W &Wfor white)&0
0 - &0 Turn the color off&0
You can use big letters for BOLD variants (eg. G is &Gbold green&0).

Other special codes:
u - &u Underline (on Xterminals)
f - &f Flashing text (on normal terminals)
v - &v Reverse mode&0

ARENA CTF

Lands of Myst MUD features a fully funcional "Capture the Flag" arena. The
rules are simple: Players join two teams (RED and BLUE) after the arena has
been opened.  Players are then randomly thrown into the arena maze, ready to
begin with the game. Each team has it's base; RED Team base is always in the
north-west corner, BLUE Team base is in the south-east corner. RED and BLUE
flags are randomly placed in the maze. RED team's job is to capture the BLUE
flag, by bringing it to RED base and typing 'capture' (and vice-versa for
the blue team. If a player dies, he/she will be transfered to a random
location in arena, and fully restored while keeping all the equpment he/she
had. Scoring:
- Killing an enemy team member counts 1 point
- Capturing enemy flag counts 5 points

Winner is the team with higher score after the arena closes.

Players may use 'teamtell' command (shortcut is '', just left of number 1 on
keyboard) to talk to their team members.

usage of ctf command (which starts the arena):
ctf lo hi delay cost length | standard
lo - min level allowed in arena
hi - maximum level allowed in arena
delay - time in mud hours before arena starts
cost - (100-1000) relative cost in coins and quest points to enter arena
length - arena length in mud hours

using option 'standard' will invoke this configuration:
lo: 7
hi: 50
delay: 3
cost: 100
length: 15

NOTICE:
There must be at least 4 players (two on both sides) to start the arena.

CLAN OUTLAW "BLUE DRAGON" NIGHTSNAKE CLANS

This clan help is outdated.

There are 4 clans in the Lands of Myst. There are some common rules of 
engagement you should know of.

   NEWBIE is the basic clan, everyone gots into when they start a new 
character. Newbies can not kill other players, nor can be killed by other 
players. When you reach level 7 you become an OUTLAW. Then you have to 
search for Abrams, enter the Wheel of Destiny room, and have your destiny 
decide your future clan.
   
   BLUE DRAGON and NIGHTSNAKE are two clans that have been in war as far as 
the world exists. As a member of these clans, you enjoy your clan's 
protection and are to slaughter as many of the opposite clan members you 
can. That's it. Simple. You can also freely attack any of the OUTLAWS buy 
may not attack NEWBIES. Also members of thiese clans have the privilege to
own a HOUSE (see help on 'houses' and 'house').

   OUTLAWS aren't actually a clan, rather a bunch of rebels that couldn't 
fit anywhere. You become an OUTLAW in either of the two ways. When you 
reach level 7 you become an OUTLAW but you can decide to choose one of the 
clans. You don't have to do it right away. The second way to become an 
OUTLAW is to be expelled from your clan (either BLUE DRAGON or the 
NIGHTSNAKE). You do that by going to Abrams and typing 'expell'. Once 
expelled, you can not join any clan ever after, and you stay an OUTLAW 
forever. OUTLAWs can attack everyone (except NEWBIEs) and can be attacked 
by everyone. The strongest OUTLAW should be their leader (because he has 
the power of teaching others the lesson *grin*).

CLERIC

  The Cleric is a holy (or unholy) defender of the tenets of his or her
faith. The arts of healing as well as calling upon the powers of dieties,
these have often been looked at as the saviours of towns and the
diseased.  In these hard times though, some have abused their powers to
inflict harm upon others, summon wild beasts to peaceful villages and
spreading plague and disease over the land.

  Clerics have an ancient belief in not carrying sharp weapons. This class
gives you the wisdom of peace, blessing and healing, though it is possible
to learn and use more violent spells.

   the dark stars They came were man was born, unseen and loathsome They
   descended to primal earth.
   
   Beneath the oceans They brooded while ages past, till seas gave up the
   land, whereupon They swarmed forth in Their multitudes and darkness
   ruled the Earth.
   
   At the frozen Poles They raised mighty cities, and upon high places
   the temples of Those whome nature owns not and the Gods have cursed.
   
   And the spawn of the Old Ones covered the Earth, and Their children
   endureth throughout the ages. Ye shantaks of Leng are the work of
   Their hands, the Ghasts who dwelleth in Zin's primordial vaults know
   Them as their Lords. They have fathered the Na-Hag and the Gaunts that
   ride the Night; Great Cthulhu is Their brother, the shaggoths Their
   slaves. The Dholes do homage unto Them in the nighted vale of Pnoth
   and Gugs sing Their praises beneath the peaks of ancient Throk.
   
   They have walked amidst the stars and They have walked the Earth. The
   City of Irem in the great desert has known Them; Leng in the Cold
   Waste has seen Their passing, the timeless citadel upon the
   cloud-vieled heights of unknown Kadath beareth Their mark.
   
   Wantonly the Old Ones trod the ways of darkness and Their blasphemies
   were great upon the Earth; all creation bowed beneath Their might and
   knew Them for Their wickedness.
   
   And the Elder Lords opened Their eyes and beheld the abominations of
   Those that ravaged the Earth. In Their wrath They set their hand
   against the Old Ones, staying Them in the midst of Their iniquity and
   casting Them forth from the Earth to the Void beyond the planes where
   chaos reigns and form abideth not. And the Elder Lords set Their seal
   upon the Gateway and the power of the Old Ones prevailest not against
   its might.
   
   Loathsome Cthulhu rose then from the deeps and raged with exceeding
   great fury against the Earth Guardians. And They bound his venomous
   claws with potent spells and sealed him up within the City of R'lyeh
   wherein beneath the waves he shall sleep death's dream until the end
   of the Aeon.
   
   Beyond the Gate dwell now the Old Ones; not in the spaces known unto
   men but in the angles betwixt them. Outside Earth's plane They linger
   and ever awaite the time of Their return; for the Earth has known Them
   and shall know Them in time yet to come.
   
   And the Old Ones hold foul and formless Azathoth for Their Master abd
   Abide with Him in the black cavern at the centre of all infinity,
   where he gnaws ravenously in ultimate chaos amid the mad beating of
   hidden drums, the tuneless piping of hideous flutes and the ceaseless
   bellowing of blind idiot gods that shamble and gesture aimlessly for
   ever.
   
   The soul of Azathoth dwelleth in Yog-sothoth and He shall beckon unto
   the Old Ones when the stars mark the time of Their coming; for
   Yog-sothoth is the Gate through which Those of the Void will re-enter.
   Yog-sothoth knowest the mazes of of time, for all time is one unto
   Him. He knowest where the Old Ones came forth in time along long past
   and where They shall come forth again when the cycle returneth.
   
   After day cometh night; man's day shall pass, and They shall rule
   where They once ruled. As foulness you shall know them and Their
   accursedness shall stain the Earth.

        Ye Adjuration of Great Cthulhu

     Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh Wgah'nagl fhtan.

 A supplication to great Cthulhu for those who would have power
over his minions.

 In the day and hour of the moon with sun in scorpio prepare thou a
waxen tablet and enscribe thereon the seals of Cthulhu and Dagon;
suffumigate with the incense of Zkauba and set aside.

 On Hallowmas eve thou must travel to some lonely place where
high ground overlooks the ocean. Take up the tablet in thy right hand
and make of the sign of Kish with thy left. Recite the incantation
thrice and when the final word of the third utterance dieth in the air
cast thou the tablet into the waves saying:

 'In His House at R'lyeh Dead Cthulhu waits dreaming,
 yet He shall rise and His kingdom shall cover the Earth.'

 And He shall come unto you in sleep and show His sign with which
ye shall unlock the secrets of the deep.



                    Ye Incantation

        O Thou that lieth dead but ever dreameth,
        Hear, Thy servant calleth Thee.
        Hear me O mighty Cthulhu!
       ' Hear me Lord of Dreams !
        In Thy tower at R'lyeh They have sealed ye,
        but Dagon shall break Thy accursed bonds,
        and Thy Kingdom shall rise once more.
        The Deep Ones knoweth Thy secret Name,
        The Hydra knoweth Thy lair;
        Give forth Thy sign that I may know
        Thy will upon the Earth.
        When death dies, Thy time shall be,
        and Thou shalt sleep no more;
        Grant me the power to still the waves,
        that I may hear Thy Call.


  (At ye third repeating of ye incantation cast forth the Tablet into ye
waves saying):

  In His House at R'lyeh Dead Cthulhu waits dreaming, yet He shall
  rise and His kingdom shall cover the Earth.

DEXTERITY INTELLIGENCE WISDOM CONSTITUTION CHARISMA STATS

  Strength measures your pure physical power. It determines things like
how much weight you can carry or push, how heavy weapons you can wield. It
also defines your bonus to damage, where strength of 16 is considered neutral,
more strength gives bigger bonus, less gives penalty.
  Intelligence determines how fast you'll be learning your skills. It also
directly defines how much energy you have and the rate of regeneration.
  Will power also your ability to remember the learned, and is connected
in this way to how good you learn your skills. Having bigger will power
will also help you better resist harmful effects of magic.
  Dexterity mirrors your reflexes, agility and speed. If you have high
dexterity, you'll be hitting your opponent more often and accurate, at
the same time avoiding more blows. It's a general combat attribute.
  Constitution is what decides your combat endurance. High constitution
character will have much more hit points and better regeneration. At the same
time, characters with higher constitution will generally receive smaller
damage and be able to better resist some physical effects like poison.
  Charisma measures your control over various situations. If you are high 
on charisma, you have smaller chances of being attacked by an aggressive 
monster, higher resistence to some magic, your luck in some situations,
the success of haggling with shopkeepers and so on.

#
DROW

Drow elves, like their surface dwelling cousins, are very
magical in their nature. The difference between the two lay in the fact
that Drow elves left the surface world for a subterranean existence. Drow
tend to dabble more in the "dark" arts of magic, and are evil in their
nature. Some Drow however are outcasts, and have decided to venture out to
the surface.

Drow elves are extremely good spellcasters, and are resistant to magic as
well. They are a lot weaker than humans physically, but compensate with a
greater intelligence. Drow are not as hardy as most races, but are more
dexterous than most as well.

Drow have developed the ability to see in the dark.
#
DRUID

 Druids draw their power from the earth, so their might stems not from dead
magic or capricious gods, but from the lifeforce of the earth itself.
Their abilities in some ways mimic the magical manipulative abilities of
adepts or the god-granted power of the clerics, but they go beyond, dealing
with primal Earthpower itself.
 Although they may not seem formidable in battle, any such preconception
will vanish when druid causes the very earth to open up beneath your feet!
The following skills and multi spells are available to druid:

#
DWARF

Famous for deeds other than the invention of the braided beard and the
double-bladed axe, the Dwarves are known to make fine warriors and 
adventurers.  Strong and hardy, Dwarves also possess a certain innate

ELF

This race is a more intelligent and magical race. Most of their
kind live in the forests, depending on the natural resources for their
existence, as well as drawing power from their surroundings to fuel their
magic. Lately, elves have been seen walking around the settlements of the
world using their perceptive abilities and magical natures to some great
effect as the world's secrets are discovered.

Elves are quick-footed, as well as quick of wit. They are also well liked
if not loved by most races as well. Elves lack in strength, and can not
take much punishment in battle; but they are magical in nature and are
excellent spellcasters. In addition to their excellence in the use of
magic, elves are slightly resistant to the effects of magic as well.

Elves all have the ability to see in darkness.
#

SHOOT FIRE

Usage       : shoot <direction> <name>


This allows you to fire something in the direction chosen, aiming the
named target. You must wield something that can fire an item, and you
must hold the item you want to launch.  For instance, you must have a
bow wielded and hold an arrow in order to fire it. Also arrows usually
hace increased range, allowing you to fire them to distance of several
rooms.

If no name is given you will simply fire in that direction, randomly
hitting someone. If name is given, there is a chance you will miss
and hit someone else.

Example:	shoot east fido

This will fire an item eastwards, aiming fido.

#
THROW

Usage       : throw <direction> <target>              
                                
This allows you to throw something in the direction chosen, aiming the
named target. You must hold or wield an item you want to throw. Order
of throwing is item dual-wielded, item wielded, item held. Thrown objects
will deal damage proportional to their damage dice, or if not weapons, 
to their weight.

If no name is given you will simply fire in that direction, randomly
hitting someone. If name is given, there is still a slight chance you
will miss and hit someone else.

Example:	throw north goblin

See also: QUICKTHROW SHOOT 
#
QUICKTHROW

Usage: quickthrow <object>

Quickthrow can be used to throw objects at your enemy while fighting,
causing damage. Thrown objects will deal damage proportional to their
damage dice, or if not weapons, to their weight. Unlike throw or shoot,
quickthrow uses objects in your inventory, and if no object name
is specified, you will throw the first dagger in your inventory instead.
To get the full effect of throwing things at mobs, it is best to
practice the thief skill 'knife throwing'.

FLEE

If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a little

out of harm's way - that is, IF there is a suitable exit nearby, and IF 
that exit doesn't simply bring you from the ashes to the fire... but then, 
who wants to live forever? 
When fleeing you loose some experience, and you might as well throw your
weapon in panic. Your opponent might get a chance to hit you in the back
while you try to run away.

"Sometimes it is better to be swift of foot than strong of swordarm."

GNOME

Gnomes are known to be small, industrious, and excellent spell-casters. 
They are comfortable living in an underground city or burrow, or in a
small home on a rolling hill in some bucolic country setting.
#
GOBLIN

Small, tough and wily, Goblins are known for being good at a lot of
things, with the general exception of magic.  Quick and hardy, goblins
make excellent thieves due to their generally high dexterity and small
stature, though persistent individuals have managed in the past to
succeed at a wide variety of careers, including magical ones.

Goblins despise daylight, dwarves, elves, and humans, and prefer to
torture and tease any creatures which they may come across.  They also
conceive of trolls and ogres as utterly insufferable, generally because,
like orcs, these races tend to use their superior size and strength to
bully goblins into doing what they don't want to do.  Goblins will not
associate with Dwarves, due to long-standing tensions and a bloody
history between the two races, nor do they particularly like Elves (of
any type).  Dwarves are viewed with outright hatred, due to their
continued butchery of innocent goblins over countless centuries.  "The
only good part of a dwarf is his scalp" states a common Goblin proverb.
#

GROUP

Usage : GROUP [player]
        GROUP all

GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <player>
adds or removes <player> from your group.  GROUP ALL adds everyone who is
following you to your group. Use NAME to give your group a name. Use 
GWHO to see all the group with their members.

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for 
killing monsters. Exp is shared in a way that the highest level character
will get the most exp, and the lowest level one gets the least.
Experience points will only be shared among group members that are in the
same location, at the time of the killing blow. Sharing is regardless of
whether the group members have been participating in the fight. 
When you are grouped you gain extra exp for every monster, and that bonus
grows bigger as the group is larger.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Redferne: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group dragon"
Dragon  : "group redferne"
Dragon  : "group quifael"

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the 
time) he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

HALFLING HOBBIT

  Halflings are a race of 'little people.'  They are small, hearty, and
generally cheerful.  Being shy, they often live in small communities
hidden deep within a forest or tunneled far into a distant hillside.
Quick and dextrious, Halflings can move all but silently through nearly
any terrain.

Most Halflings live in their own communities, though they do trade heavily
with Humans and Dwarves.  Halflings are common in the Human cities, often
in taverns discussing adventure over a hearty mug of ale.  Halflings are
fascinated by Elves.  They consider them beautiful and mysterious, though
the Elves' strange customs are an utter cipher to the down-to-earth
Halflings.  Gnomes and Halflings have amicable, if distant, relations.
Goblins and Orcs are hated with a passion by Halflings and meetings
between them are usually short and bloody.

primary owner of a house (not guests) may change the guest list using the
HOUSE command.

Usage: house [<player name>]

Typing 'house' with no arguments gives a list of the people currently on
your house's guest list.  Typing 'house' with the name of a player will add
that player to your guest list if the player is not on the list, or will
remove the player from the guest list if the player is already on the list.
The player specified must be in the player database for the MUD, although
he or she does not necessarily have to be logged on at the time.

Guests of your house will be able to enter your house until you remove them
from the guest list.

HOUSES

You get a right to own a house by becoming a legal clan member (Nighstnake
or Blue Dragon).The best thing is that you get to design the look
of your house. You have to send it to mud@afrodita.rcub.bg.ac.yu, both
the room description for your house and your garden in front of the house).
People will be able to step into your garden but not into your house unless
they are on your guest list.  A house entails two 
things: access control and crash protection.  Only you and your guests will 
be allowed to enter the house.  Your house will be crash-saved every five 
minutes.  You can force your house to save by typing 'save' while standing 
in your house. In the event of a crash, the objects in your house as of the 
last crash-save will be loaded back into your house when the MUD reboots.  

Guests of your house can be defined using the HOUSE command.  See HOUSE for
more information.

#
LEAVE

#
LINK

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.
#
LIST

If you'd like to see what items a shop has for sale, take a look at the

list.
 
Examples:
 
> list             (list all items for sale)
> list sword       (list all swords for sale)
> list 5           (list all items of level 5 and higher)

MONK

  The Monk class is an old class of men and women who have mastered the 
skills of hand-to-hand. Their life, from a very young age, is spent in 
study in a dojo or monastery. At the age of 17, the masters of the martial
artist student encourage him to leave the cloistered life and explore
the world.

  Warriors without peers, the fighting Monk learns to use all parts of his
body as lethal weapons. After gaining experience in this class, the Monk 
acquires skills that inflict tremendous amounts of damage to their 
opponents. Their religion forbids them the usage of weapons and shields
which made them unbeatable in unarmed combat.
The following skills are available to monk:

Level   Skill                   
----------------------------------
1 : Enhanced sight, Fillet, Cook
3 : Dodge
5 : Quivering palm
6 : Consider

CIRCLEMUD  

                    C  I  R  C  L  E  M  U  D     3  .  0

CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink, for submitting a veritable mountain of excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Furry (Alex Fletcher), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven, for porting the code to the Amiga.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns, for allowing Circle to exist.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- And, of course, Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.
...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!

MULTI

Multi spells are called so because they can not be cast by a single caster. 
In order to successfuly cast the spell caster must be grouped with other 
spell-casters (that means DRUIDS, MAGES or CLERICS). Their total mana must 
exceed the mana needed for casting the spell. Also every single caster must 
be at least MINLV level to participate in casting. MULTI spells are known 
for their undescribable either destructive or defensive powers.

OGRE

As a general rule, Ogres are big, mean, and dumb.  They make wonderful
warriors but generally feeble wizards and clerics, due to their innate
tendencies towards high strength and constitution and low intelligence
and wisdom. Their great size is often of use in combat as well, making
them excellent bashers. They are fond of treasure, and are often employed 
as mercenaries by evil races in particular. They tend to have yellowish 
hides, are covered with wart-like bumps, have black teeth and talons, and 
purplish eyes with white pupils. Ogres are exceptionally strong and hardy, 
but are known to be extremely dim-witted and lacking in wisdom. They are 
excellent in melee combat, but are extremely limited when they attempt to 
utilize magic. Ogre mages and clerics, rare though they may be,
are not unknown to the realms.

Ogres do not like little creatures, who tend to cause problems and/or
steal things.  If they cannot be bullied, they should be smashed.

ORC

A bit slow and a bit dumb, Orcs are nevertheless know to be tough, wily

Orcs prefer the dark confines of underground caverns and the hidden
realms of the underworld to the light of day, and will emerge into

QUAFF POTION POTIONS

Usage: quaff <potion>

Quaff is used to "drink" a (magical) potion.  The magic will take effect 
immediately, for better or for worse...

       
Potions are typically used to augment spells and for healing in the aftermath
of battles, but quaffing in combat is possible.
  
You may quaff in battle, but must perform a check against your dexterity
with the following cumulative modifiers:
  
        -4      if fighting, as your attention is somewhat distracted by your
                eager opponent trying to remove all your limbs from your body

        -4      if wielding a weapon, as you must now defer to your offhand

        -4      if wielding a weapon and a shield, as now you require a third
                hand which you have just discovered that you do not have

        +5      if you have the potion already held (hold potion)

If you fail your check, the potion will break.

As potions take some time to get, uncap and quaff, a slight delay will 
result before you actually quaff the potion.

LIST command. Both of these commands are only available when you are at 
your questmaster's location (for example Willie in the Midgaard Zoo). These 
items can not be found or bought anywhere else. QUEST TIME will show the 
remaining time for the completition of your quest. QUEST INFO will inform 
you briefly about your quest. QUEST REQUEST will assign you a quest if one 
is available. You can do only one quest at a time. When you finish your 
quest, go to your questmaster and type QUEST COMPLETE.

If there was a reboot during your quest, just type 'quest info' afterwards,
which will make sure you don't lose any quest points.

There are also global quests like "Gift of Fury" occuring, and you
can get more info on them as they are activated.

QUI SHUTDOW

Just to prevent accidental quittings and/or shutdowns.
This command doesn't DO anything, it simply is.
#
QUIT

When you get tired of playing, you can leave the game by typing 'quit'.
Note that quitting this way causes any items you might be carrying to
simply be left on the ground.  If you wish to have your equipment stored,
you'll have to find an inn and pay rent.

RANGER

  The history of the ranger is as long as it is interesting. Rangers
were first used in the great wars as quick moving, lightly armored
scouts during the ancient wars. Later, they were known as heavy
hitting elite strike forces with extensive training in woodcraft and
wilderness survival. In the peaceful years before the current era
they were primarily caretakers of the forests and wilder wilderness
areas near the big cities. In the current era of constant conflict
and wars, the Rangers are great survivors.

The following spells are available to ranger:

RECITE SCROLL SCROLLS

Use : Recite <Scroll> [Target]

Is used to "read" a magical scroll. Target can be an object, character or
nothing (which may be yourself).
 
You may recite scrolls in battle, but must perform a check against your 
dexterity with the following cumulative modifiers:
  
    -4      if fighting, as your attention is somewhat distracted by your
            eager opponent trying to remove all your limbs from your body

    -4      if wielding a weapon, as you must now defer to your offhand

    -4      if wielding a weapon and a shield, as now you require a third
            hand which you have just discovered that you do not have

    +5      if you already have the scroll prepared in your hand (hold scroll)

If you fail your check, the scroll will probably tear apart. While reciting
a scroll you will not be able to attack and your defense will be somewhat
weaker.

#
REGENERATION

This shows you how fast you regenerate your hitpoints, mana and move per
tick. There are items and spells that can enhance your regeneration.                                          

You regenerate faster when you are resting and sleeping, and slower when you
are hungry, sick or fighting.

REMOVE

> remove boots
> remove sword
> remove all
> remove all.bronze

#
REPEAT

Use REPEAT to control whether or not the mud echoes your communication 
commands to you (i.e. the MUD will tell you what you just said, group-said,
shouted, or told someone).  This is useful to verify what you just said, 
but can be annoying if you have a slow link.

#
REPORT

This command sends a report of your current and max hp and mana to your
group.  You can use this command to let potential rescuers know how
low your hps are without forcing them to use the "group" command.  It is
designed as a convenience for groups with members who get lag or have slow
modems.

> report
#
RESIZE

Syntax: resize <number_of_lines>

This command will set your current screen settings used when DISPLAY is set 
to VT100. By default it is set to 24.

#
RSTAT

RSTAT shows room stats, just like 'STAT ROOM', but allows you to stat 
remote rooms.  If no room is specified, you will see the stats of the 
room you are currently in.

rstat [room #]

> rstat
> rstat 3001

See also:  RSET
#
SAVE

Save your persona.  This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash.  The
game periodically auto-saves you and your equipment, so it is not necessary
to have your client auto-save you as well.

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists,
but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.

Note that the SAVE command only saves your equipment in the event of a
crash.  

> save

#
SAY TELL ASK WHISPER SHOUT YELL HOLLER ' SAYTO

If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be understood
better if you start your sentences with either say, tell, whisper or shout.

<say | shout | holler> <string>
<tell | whisper | ask | sayto> <player> <string>

> say Hey, does anyone know how to get to Oz?
> tell uncle hi, how are you?

You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in: ' hello there.

Shout broadcasts your message to everyone is your geographic zone.  Holler
broadcasts to everyone in the game but costs 20 movement points.  You must
be level 2 before you can use shout and yell.

#
SCORE

Whenever you want to check whether you're still alive and healthy
or simply want to see how much money you have left.
#
SELL

If you'd like to sell an item to a shopkeeper, trying selling it to them.
Most shops specialize in what they will buy, so you may have to look around
to find a buyer for your items.
 
Examples:
 
> sell sword       (sell the first sword in your inventory)
> sell 3 sword     (sell the first three swords in your inventory)

#
SHOPS

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his 
quests,and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive 
the perils with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a 
specific type of merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your 
armor, even if it is of high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop 
by murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers 
are often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, 
surviving in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

#
SHUTDOWN

Shutdown is now timed, with a message appearing at the 5 minute mark, the 3 
minute mark, the 1 minute mark, the 30 second mark, and a final ten second
countdown starting at the 10 second mark.

Mortals, Immortals, Gods and Greater Gods can type shutdown to see whether
	Lostlands is shutting down, and if so, how much time is left.

Implementors can specify the following type of shutdown:
	shutdown time			reports time until shutdown.
	shutdown <no arg>		5 Minute
	shutdown reboot			1 Minute
	shutdown die			10 seconds
	shutdown remake			30 seconds, forces a make.
	shutdown pause			30 seconds, pauses autorun indefinitely.
	shutdown off			cancels shutdown

Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others.  The
actor, victim and bystanders may receive different messages.  Generally,
social commands are used only to express emotion, but it is possible that
some mobs (or players) will take action based on the social.

SPELL SPELLS MANA "SAVING THROW" SAVING_

Spells are ways for spellcasters to express their powers. In order to use
spells, one must spend some of his MANA energy.  Power of all damaging
spells is halved if the victim save a throw versus spell. Furthermore,
SANCTUARY will halve every damage creature is taking, so it will for the
spells. Protection spells (like prot lightning or prot fire) will also lower
the damage taken from corresponding spells. If fire spells are used during
wet conditions (eg. during rain or in water conditions) their damage is also
lowered. Also, intelligence of the caster greatly affects the destructive
power of his spells. At INT of 18 all spells will be casted with 100% power.
Higher INT means more power, lower INT means less.

For list of spells available to your class see help on your class.

SPLIT

Usage:  SPLIT <amount to split>

SPLIT is used to split money among people in your group who are in the same
room as you.  If you are in a group with 4 other people, all of whom are in
the same room with you, and you type SPLIT 100, you will give each of the
other 4 group members 20 coins each.  (100 coins is split 5 ways; you keep
your share and give everyone else their share).

#
STRING

For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters. The
format is:

string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.
Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):
Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at. For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@'.

Mobiles and objects currently can not be strung.

STROM

 	                  STROM'S LOST LANDS

STROM'S LOST LANDS was developed from CircleMUD (3.00bpl8), which was 
developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0).

STROM'S LOST LANDS branched from kosher CircleMUD code by more than 20%.
And thus can be thought of as a derivative of Circle.

STROM'S LOST LANDS was developed by Billy Chan during many lunch breaks
and staying late through the night while working at WindRiver Systems.

I'd like to thank the following people for their help during the development
of STROM'S LOST LANDS:
  
  -- Mike Scheel for the wonderful testing and building.
  -- Clara Ko for understanding and giving me permission to MUD.
  -- Joe Hull and John Wier (theTick and Rimmer) for bug testing and building.
  -- Levork for Iedit and Redit.
  -- Josh Steadman, for some cool areas
  -- Silly MUD for the teleport rooms.
  -- The friends of Strom on Mortal Realms, for giving me the idea of what
     would make a good MUD.
  -- The CircleMUD folks and the DikuMUD folks, for starting the ball rolling.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
	Pink Floyd <floyd@south.mit.edu> for do_scan
	samedi for some of the OLC stuff
Thanks everyone!

THIEF

  The thief is a person which exists alongside society, rather than within, 
or even necessarily without.  The thief lives by skills and cunning, and 
relies on the elements of surprise, trickery, and stealth.

  The prime requisite of thieves is dexterity which makes them very    
slippery opponents. Strength is desirable to make their primary attack,
the backstab, more powerful and to allow them to carry more loot.      
Intelligence is a big plus, allowing them to learn their skills quickly
and expertly as well as to assist their streetsmarts. And as with all  
classes, a hardy constitution will help them survive in the lethal     
dark alleyways and sidestreets of the big cities.

Trolls are big and slow.  Make that BIG.  Known for their prowess in
battle, their superior physical attributes, and their great size, Trolls
are known to be unsurpassed warriors.  Along with these physical traits
comes a particular dimness of mind and of senses, and Trolls able to cast
spells are rare, and often less than competent.

USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS

Use : Use <Staff>
      Use <Wand> <Target>

Using staff's will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, execpt yourself. Therefore staff's are naturally very powerful, and
yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be eihter a
character or an object.

Both staff's and wand's must be HELD in the hand prior to use! (Use the
grab or hold commands). You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.
#
VALUE

Before selling an item to a shop, you can ask the shopkeeper how much
he or she is willing to pay for it.

Also, you can value an item in the shopkeeper's inventory to see whether
you can use that item or not.
Example:
 
> value bread

#
DESCRIBE

Before buying an item from a shop, you may ask the shopkeeper to describe
you the item in more detail. This will usually cost about one fifth of the
item price but may save you money in the long run.

Example:
 
> describe sword
> describe #4

#
REPAIR CONDITION

This command is used in shops when you want to repair your equipment.
Damaged weapons and armors are less effective then those in excellent
condition.

Example:

If you want to repair your sword
> repair sword

If you want to repair all your equipment
> repair all

#
VISIBLE

Use this command to break your spell of invisibility before it expires.
#
WAKE SLEEPING REST SIT STAND

For changing your position.  If you feel weary, it's probably a good idea
to sit and rest for a while, or maybe even take a nap. By doing this you 
restore your hit, mana and movement points faster than usual.

WARRIOR FIGHTER

 It seems that most cultures have one thing in common, a need      
for warriors. These are the men and women who train from birth      
to survive the lethal environment of close combat with weapons      
and armor. These soldiers, mercenaries, guards, etc. utilize        
their knowledge of armor, weapons, and tactics to great effect.     
While they may not have a lot of skills with which to draw from,    
the skills they do learn are extremely effective, and are generally 
learned quite early.  The only drawback of the warrior lies in      
its main strength, its simplicity.                                  
  The prime requisite of Warriors is strength, giving them the      
capacity to mete out more damage, and carry more gear and           
equipment than any other class.

&0

This table may be incorrect - use 'skills' command to get your skills.
#
ACTION ABORT

Use 'abort' command to abort currently performed action (like wearing 
objects, reciting scroll).
#
NOMISSE NOMISSF

Use these commands to toggle display of missed hits for enemies and friends
(including you).
#
SKY STARS STARMAP CONSTELLATION

The night sky in the Lands of Myst is host to many stars.
The ancients recognized patterns in these stars and named many
constellations after them.  Throughout the year you may be able
to 'look sky' and pick out some of the most famous ones, including:

&W  Lupus   &G Gigas&M  Pyx &y Enigma&c Centaurus&B Terken&R Raptus
&W   The    &G  The &M  The &y  The  &c   The    &B  The  &R  The  
&WWhite Wolf&G Giant&M Pixie&y Sphinx&c  Centaur &B  Drow &R Raptor&x

Starmap was written by nebseni. Hail to him.
#
PUSH DRAG

Usage: push <character | object> <direction>
       drag <character | object> <direction>
       
       
You may use push command to push someone or something out of the room.
Example:
> push guard north

Drag command is similar to push except that you will also move in desired
direction, together with your target. Also, target must be at least in
sitting position in order to be draged (that means it must be on the ground).

> drag corpse south
> drag fido west

Success depends upon your strength versus target's strength and their weight.
PUSH and DRAG skills further improve your chances.
#
WALK RUN WALKING RUNNING

Syntax: walk
Syntax: run

Use these commands to set your default movement state. Running is the normal
way, but you may also chose to walk. When walking, you will use significantly
less movement points, and will have much greater chance to avoid being attacked
by an agressive mob. It will only take more time to move from one place
to another.

SEE ALSO: WALKIN WALKOUT
#
WALKIN WALKOUT WALKSET

Syntax: walkin <text> | "off"
Syntax: walkout <text> | "off"

Thic command allows you to set your custom enter and exit messages. You can use
the '#' character in place of the proper direction. It is optional to use it in
walkin, but is neccessary in walkout string.

Examples:

> walkin suddenly appears before your eyes
> walkin arrives from the #, cheering everyone

> walkout leaves #
> walkout rides a dragon to the #

#
REPLAY

REPLAY displays the last 10 tells you received. This is quite useful for
the tells you tend to miss during battles.
#
EGO "EGO WEAPONS" "EGO ARMORS"

There are many legends of specially crafted weapons and armors, inscribed by
magical runes to give them potent powers and abilities. These items are
called "ego" weapons and armors. Their secret remains unfolded, until they
are identified. Lesser and greater egos exist each with it's own set of
affects. Any weapon or armor can be one of the "ego" ones, so maybe that
crummy sword you are holding is one of the {Bonebreakers}?

You can use 'ego weapons' and 'ego armors' command to list known egos.
#
/ PRIVATE POPEN PCLOSE PADD PREMOVE PWHO

LOM supports so called private-channels. You can open one with 'popen'.
You can then add people to it with 'padd' and remove them with 'premove'. Use
'private' or '/' to communicate. You can also type 'phelp' to get a brief help
on commands. 
#
SACRIFICE

usage: sacrifice <obj>

With this command you offer a sacrifice to your God. Depending on the value of
the sacrifice you may be awarded or even punished.

With proper sacrifices you gain faith points and your Deity gets pleased with
you. Sacrifice corpses and objects of level near or bigger then yours to gain
faith.

#
"ATTACK BONUS" "ATTACK ROLL"

This shows your estimated bonus when trying to hit someone. The bigger it is
the more likely you will hit your opponent on combat.

30. May 2001
------------ 
* Nove erije! Za sada samo dve i to u razvitku ali dovoljno da uzivate u njima
  Pristupate im tako sto na obe kapije midgaarda postoji portal i samo kucate
  'enter portal'.
  new features:
  - exiti north-west, north-east itd.
  - hidden exiti, znaci morate provaliti iz opisa sobe
  - za prelzanje nekih soba potrebna interakcija sa mobovima (sa npr say)
  - jos svasta...
* ekonomija poboljsana. Keeperi daju pouste i kupuju koliko im treba.
  Oruzja i armori imaju vecu vrednost.
* combat sistem imao glup bug de je mobovima dodge bio setovan na nula
  sto je rezultovalo u tome da se u borbama sa njima retko promasuje.
  Kako je cilj da borbe traju duze da bi moglo da se razmislja malo
  uradjene su sledece stvari:
  1. dodge bug sredjen. 
  2. enhanced damage efekat umanjen za 5%

  [ime za ego] [za koje levele otprilike] [sta bi trebao da radi/povecava]

CHANGELOG_1
  
  
18. May 2001
------------
* mobovi imaju ujednacenije karakteristike. Upozorenje: zbog ovoga ce drugacije tuci nego do sada
* sredjen bug sa expom. mobovi ne daju vise toliko mnogo expa.
* pick lock, bashdoor, envenom popravljeni
* skillove moguce improve-ovati preko 100% - samo veoma tesko

13. May 2001
------------
* double-death bug konacno ispravljen
* envenom radi i na wieldovan item. inicijalni udarac sa posionovanim
  weaponom ce praviti veci damage, zavisno od znanju u ovom skillu
* shield mastery povecava sanse za bash
* move hidden radi isto kao i sneak, a skill se proverava kod svakog move-a



09. May 2001
------------
* sposobnost za combat zavisi i od healtha, tj. sto je neko vise ranjen slabije
  ce napadati i braniti se
* repairman prima 'repair all' komandu, posle koje ce probati da popravi sav
  eq koji nosite
* gutovani "trofeji" ostaju posle logovanja      
* popravljene "nepravilnosti" u promptu 

= Jack: sa '=' komandom ponistavas sve zadate komande u baferu
= Chandalen: 'damroll' na snagu vec postoji. Radi tako sto se damage mnozi
  za koeficijentom. Za snagu 16 koef. je 1.0, za snagu 	25 je 1.80!

29. April 2001
--------------
* kada kucate 'combat' moci cete da vidite jos jednu stavku po imenu attack
  roll. Ona predstavlja vas ukupan izracunati bonus u borbi.
* logove saljete tako sto copy&pastujete sadrzaj ekrana u trenutku kada
  se desi nesto zanimljivo i posaljete ga meni na mail  
  
  

26. April 2001
--------------
* weapon shopkeeperi pravilno kupuju bow-ove sada
* grip skill utice i na scrollove i potione
* postanske markice pojeftinile na pristupacnih 5 coina
* gateguardovi vise ne prave onoliku guzvu
* male izmene na combat enginu (dex se gleda realnije, style isto)
* CTF arena ponovo radi. Komande 'awho' i 'ahall' ponovo rade.
* ispravljen bug kad se mud crashuje zbog ego armora
* blacksmith u Sundhavenu takodje popravlja stvari
* znate za mobove koji umru sami od sebe tik pre nego sto ih ubijete i ostave
  vas bez expa? Vise to nece raditi. (nego ce naglo skociti sa zemlje i
  pojesti vas prim. aut.)

= curse i slicno na sac se dobija kada zrtva nije prigodna. Naprimer level ste
  15 i zrtvujete puza ili snotlinga. Konkretno, gleda se level razlika izmedju
  vas i zrtve i sto je zrtvin nivo veci Bogovi ce biti zadovoljniji i ceka vas
  nagrada. Ako cistite neku eriju sa jako slabim mobovima onda bolje iskljucite
  autosac jer Bogove bas briga sto vi to radite zbog expa.
= da, 'bashdoor' radi i na sirovu snagu. To znaci ako si bas mrcina, provalices.
= dobijanje ponovnih adv poena ima veze sa restartovanjem muda. 
  tj. sa dodavanjem novih mobova (pomere se indexi). Za sada je to normalno
  dok se ne finalizuju erije.
= mobovi iz mud schoola izrazili zelju da igraju protiv nasih fudbalera


23. April 2001
--------------
* cursovani itemi se na odbacuju tako lako vise
* novac vise ne pada sa neba (penny lane, rudnik...)

* ispravljen wear all.nesto bug
* za flee se od sada gubi konstantan exp (50)
* Yoda leci i drunk od sada
* sacrifice ima neki stvarni ucinak. Bice detaljnije kada se urade bozanstva


? par ljudi je prijavilo da svetlo ne radi kako treba. Neka neko posalje log
? isto vazi i za dupliranje opreme. Ako se ponovi posaljite log       
? "dragon me zapali i ubije pa ginem dva puta jednom od dragon drugi put 
  od vatre kod smrti". Ne mogu da ponovim ovo. Treba mi log kad se desi
  sledeci put.
       
! Cim primetite bug koristite komandu 'bug'. Za korisne ideje komanda 'idea'       


16. April 2001
--------------
* shopkeeperi vise ne kupuju mnogo ostecene stvari
* objekti se teze "damaguju". repair komanda disablovana (bice poseban skill)
* vraceno %t (stanje tankera) u prompt opcije
* komanda 'ego' radi. Ona treba da pokaze listu poznatih (identifikovanih) ego itema         
* kada vise ljudi/monstera bije samo jednog coveka/monstera, njemu nije lako. tj
  uradjeno je da ga lakse pogadjaju (overhelmovan je protivnicima)
* ispravljen bug sa improve-ovanjem combat skillova

#
AMURON

Amuron - Greater God of souls and death

The taker of souls after dying. Followers of Amuron do not lose any equipment
when they die (unless PK-ed), and are fully restored. If their faith is good
Amuron will take less experience from them the when they die.
#
VALERIA

Valeria - Greater Goddess of birth and life, eternal mother

Followers of Valeria always regenerate faster. They are also under constant
Valeria's protection, which lowers any damage inflicted to them. There were
cases of her most faithful followers restoring to full health when they
were about to die.
#
AZ

Az - Greater God of knowledge

God of order, law and knowledge of all things. His followers gain many gifts
related to learning and studying. They learn skills much better and improve
them much faster. When they die they don't lose skill points. In order to
follow Az you need to have intelligence and will power of at least 18. Az
likes when his followers discover new things and will heartly award them with
experience whenever they gain adventure points. Trolls and goblins can not
follow Az as they are too chaotic. Az will also not accept any thieves
as followers.
#
SKIG

Skig - God of thievery and deceivement

Followers of Skig automatically gain backstab. hide, peek and steal skills.
They receive certain bonuses when using these skills (backstab is more precise
and painful, they steal with more chance to succeed etc). Skig's followers set
deadly traps, and they will always deal more damage then those set by ordinary
rogues. Skig demands constant and good sacrifices. In return he will often
help his followers in fight, tripping and sending dirt into their oppponent's
eyes. If you fail to provide him with good sacrifices, he might do those things
to you. Skig is also very greedy and will use any chance to 'tax' you, 
taking some of your gold. When you try to follow someone there is a chance you
will attack them instead.
#
URG

Urg - God of battle and bloodshed

God of combat, battle for battle, bloodshed and enjoyment in it. Followers
automatically gain aggressive style to 100% and are obliged to use it. They
also gain enhanced damage and berserk. They automatically berserk when they 
enter combat, but experience no combat lag. On higher levels berserk becomes
bloodlust and there is a chance to hit anyone even your group members. 
Followers are obliged to sacrifice _everything_ they kill in the honor of Urg.
If his followers are performing well, Urg will grant them his godly blessing.
Followers of Urg improve combat skills faster then others.
#
BOUGAR

Bougar - God of chaos and destruction

One of his manifestations is through weather that becomes worse as more victims
are sacrificed to his honor. Thunders roar and lightnings struck all around
his followers hiting anyone around not following Bourgar. That's why his
followers are mostly lonely individuals completly devoted to chaos. When they
fight Bourgar will often help them sending lighting bolts and meteor storms
upon their foes. Sacrifices are not enough for eternal hunger of Bougar and
his followers will pay him more in experience, and even more should their faith
be low. Thus they level harder, but make it up with the great powers Bougar
grants them.
#
MUGRAK

Mugrak - God of suffering and pain

Everything around Mugrak's followers is devoted to bringing pain and suffering,
Mugrak is constantly draining health from his followers and they will have
negative regeneration no matter what they do. When they die, they will be fully
restored and wont lose health until they return. Only way to replenish health
is to inflict pain and damage to others, restoring one point of health for
every three damage inflicted which is the main strength of Mugrak's followers.
They may even temporarily go over their max hitpoints. Health can also be 
gained with sacrifices worth of Mugrak's name. Followers of Mugrak gain unique
ability to transform their energy to health and vice versa.    

If they try to heal or cure, the effect will be completly opposite to the
target (even themselves). Instead of gaining hitpoints, target will lose them
without any chances to reduce the damage (so no armor, magical or other forms
of protection help). This pure manifestation of pain will not however restore
any hitpoints to Mugrak follower. 
#
VETIIN

Vetiin - God of hunt and celebrations

God of good hunt and good celebration in the honor of hunt. His followers
are exceptional hunters and will always sneak in forest. They have the ability
to forage for food. Their archery skill is exceptional. Whenever they eat,
their healt replenishes. They are famous for organizing celebrations. They are
resistant to the effects of drunkness in combat, and are immune to magical
cure drunkness, but get sober faster. They replenish healt by drinkning.
Sometimes after good sacrifice and good drink, they may gain special
inspiration for combat granted by Ventiin. It will last for as long they are
drunk, and during that time they will be unable to miss their opponents and
every hit will count as having strength 25. Ventiin's followers despise
cities and civilization thus hey will not regenerate in cities. Cunning
shopkeepers tend to sell them goods for greater prices, having recognized their
lack of trading skills.
