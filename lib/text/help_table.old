may be used repeatedly and in any order:

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

ANGALOT

The History of Angalot, Heroic Druid from the Rain Forest

        Many tales of brave and heroic adventurers are told in these days
of thunder. Many tales of struggle for prevail, of treason, of stealth,
murder and sinister plans; but also, stories about strong, brave, 
courageous, and wise ones, those who use the power of their arms and their
minds to ruthlessly fight against evil forces that threaten to eternally
darken the skies above and souls within.
        These tales are told among the common people, and a-many of them
is about one powerful adventurer who fights his way through the cruel
world, seeking for vengeance upon those who made him suffer. But one story
is different of all others; it is told with upper delight and with strange
glinting in the eye, as the character the tale is about is a young and
brave female.
        Once upon a time, there was a small village of gnomes who lived
their merry lives on the edge of a little forest. They were foragers,
lived peacefully and had almost no idea about the meaning of the incoming
news (which weren't many) about the threat that has started to spread
along the country.
It has happened that a troup of savage Orcs was passing near their village
while on a scouting assignment. Gnomes spotted them and, frightened by
their ugly faces, foul stench and big swords, and since they never have
seen anything like them before, thought that Orcs were on their way to
slay them.
Mothers began to run with their children in their arms and with fear in
their eyes, while males stood before the village, trembling, with wooden
clubs in their hands.
Orcs were ruthless and longed for battle, so they slaughtered the entire
village, both men and women, elders and children. Nobody had survived to
warn about the incoming enemy troops.
Actually, there was one survivor, a small baby, a girl named Rineltha.
She would have died there, alone in the forest, in the pool of blood of
her dead mother, if it wasn't for a pair of elves who were friends with
her village and lived nearby. They heard the sounds of battle, and
mourning of wounded, and silence, and they set out to see if there were
any survivors. And they found Rineltha there, at the very brink of her
life...

        Rineltha grew in a nice family, surrounded by love and in direct
contact with Nature. Her foster-parents named her "Angalot", meaning "iron
flower" in high-elven. She grew more beautiful and wise as the years
passed; when, on her 17th birthday, her parents told her everything they
knew about her. Determined as she was, she told them goodbye, as they were
afraid she will do, took a few of her belongings she thought she might use
in the cold outside world and set out to seek revenge...

ANSI COLOR

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you see.

> color off
This command disables all color.

> color on
This command enables colors.

You can use these color codes in your PROMPT or in your TITLE:
Color sequence starts with the && character (SHIFT 7) followed by

l -&l Black
r -&r Red
g -&g Green
y -&y Yellow
b -&b Blue
p -&p Purple (magenta)
c -&c Cyan
w -&w White (looks grey in normal terminals, use &W for white)
0 -&0 Turn the color off
You can use big letters for BOLD variants (eg. G is &G bold green&0).

Other special codes:
u -&u Underline (on Xterminals)
f -&f Flashing text (on normal terminals)
v -&v Reverse mode&0

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY 
slightly. The effect is more noticable on slower connections.  Even if you 
have color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down at 
all.

CLAN OUTLAW "BLUE DRAGON" NIGHTSNAKE CLANS

There are 4 clans in the Lands of Myst. There are some common rules of 
engagement you should know of.

   NEWBIE is the basic clan, everyone gots into when they start a new 
character. Newbies can not kill other players, nor can be killed by other 
players. When you reach level 7 you become an OUTLAW. Then you have to 
search for Abrams, enter the Wheel of Destiny room, and have your destiny 
decide your future clan.
   
   BLUE DRAGON and NIGHTSNAKE are two clans that have been in war as far as 
the world exists. As a member of these clans, you enjoy your clan's 
protection and are to slaughter as many of the opposite clan members you 
can. That's it. Simple. You can also freely attack any of the OUTLAWS buy 
may not attack NEWBIES. Also members of thiese clans have the privilege to
own a HOUSE (see help on 'houses' and 'house').

   OUTLAWS aren't actually a clan, rather a bunch of rebels that couldn't 
fit anywhere. You become an OUTLAW in either of the two ways. When you 
reach level 7 you become an OUTLAW but you can decide to choose one of the 
clans. You don't have to do it right away. The second way to become an 
OUTLAW is to be expelled from your clan (either BLUE DRAGON or the 
NIGHTSNAKE). You do that by going to Abrams and typing 'expell'. Once 
expelled, you can not join any clan ever after, and you stay an OUTLAW 
forever. OUTLAWs can attack everyone (except NEWBIEs) and can be attacked 
by everyone. The strongest OUTLAW should be their leader (because he has 
the power of teaching others the lesson *grin*).

CTHULHU

   
Of Ye Old Ones and their Spawn

   The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are and the Old Ones shall be. From
   the dark stars They came were man was born, unseen and loathsome They
   descended to primal earth.
   
   Beneath the oceans They brooded while ages past, till seas gave up the
   land, whereupon They swarmed forth in Their multitudes and darkness
   ruled the Earth.
   
   At the frozen Poles They raised mighty cities, and upon high places
   the temples of Those whome nature owns not and the Gods have cursed.
   
   And the spawn of the Old Ones covered the Earth, and Their children
   endureth throughout the ages. Ye shantaks of Leng are the work of
   Their hands, the Ghasts who dwelleth in Zin's primordial vaults know
   Them as their Lords. They have fathered the Na-Hag and the Gaunts that
   ride the Night; Great Cthulhu is Their brother, the shaggoths Their
   slaves. The Dholes do homage unto Them in the nighted vale of Pnoth
   and Gugs sing Their praises beneath the peaks of ancient Throk.
   
   They have walked amidst the stars and They have walked the Earth. The
   City of Irem in the great desert has known Them; Leng in the Cold
   Waste has seen Their passing, the timeless citadel upon the
   cloud-vieled heights of unknown Kadath beareth Their mark.
   
   Wantonly the Old Ones trod the ways of darkness and Their blasphemies
   were great upon the Earth; all creation bowed beneath Their might and
   knew Them for Their wickedness.
   
   And the Elder Lords opened Their eyes and beheld the abominations of
   Those that ravaged the Earth. In Their wrath They set their hand
   against the Old Ones, staying Them in the midst of Their iniquity and
   casting Them forth from the Earth to the Void beyond the planes where
   chaos reigns and form abideth not. And the Elder Lords set Their seal
   upon the Gateway and the power of the Old Ones prevailest not against
   its might.
   
   Loathsome Cthulhu rose then from the deeps and raged with exceeding
   great fury against the Earth Guardians. And They bound his venomous
   claws with potent spells and sealed him up within the City of R'lyeh
   wherein beneath the waves he shall sleep death's dream until the end
   of the Aeon.
   
   Beyond the Gate dwell now the Old Ones; not in the spaces known unto
   men but in the angles betwixt them. Outside Earth's plane They linger
   and ever awaite the time of Their return; for the Earth has known Them
   and shall know Them in time yet to come.
   
   And the Old Ones hold foul and formless Azathoth for Their Master abd
   Abide with Him in the black cavern at the centre of all infinity,
   where he gnaws ravenously in ultimate chaos amid the mad beating of
   hidden drums, the tuneless piping of hideous flutes and the ceaseless
   bellowing of blind idiot gods that shamble and gesture aimlessly for
   ever.
   
   The soul of Azathoth dwelleth in Yog-sothoth and He shall beckon unto
   the Old Ones when the stars mark the time of Their coming; for
   Yog-sothoth is the Gate through which Those of the Void will re-enter.
   Yog-sothoth knowest the mazes of of time, for all time is one unto
   Him. He knowest where the Old Ones came forth in time along long past
   and where They shall come forth again when the cycle returneth.
   
   After day cometh night; man's day shall pass, and They shall rule
   where They once ruled. As foulness you shall know them and Their
   accursedness shall stain the Earth.
     _________________________________________________________________
   

        Ye Adjuration of Great Cthulhu

     Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh Wgah'nagl fhtan.

 A supplication to great Cthulhu for those who would have power
over his minions.

 In the day and hour of the moon with sun in scorpio prepare thou a
waxen tablet and enscribe thereon the seals of Cthulhu and Dagon;
suffumigate with the incense of Zkauba and set aside.

 On Hallowmas eve thou must travel to some lonely place where
high ground overlooks the ocean. Take up the tablet in thy right hand
and make of the sign of Kish with thy left. Recite the incantation
thrice and when the final word of the third utterance dieth in the air
cast thou the tablet into the waves saying:

 'In His House at R'lyeh Dead Cthulhu waits dreaming,
 yet He shall rise and His kingdom shall cover the Earth.'

 And He shall come unto you in sleep and show His sign with which
ye shall unlock the secrets of the deep.



                    Ye Incantation

        O Thou that lieth dead but ever dreameth,
        Hear, Thy servant calleth Thee.
        Hear me O mighty Cthulhu!
       ' Hear me Lord of Dreams !
        In Thy tower at R'lyeh They have sealed ye,
        but Dagon shall break Thy accursed bonds,
        and Thy Kingdom shall rise once more.
        The Deep Ones knoweth Thy secret Name,
        The Hydra knoweth Thy lair;
        Give forth Thy sign that I may know
        Thy will upon the Earth.
        When death dies, Thy time shall be,
        and Thou shalt sleep no more;
        Grant me the power to still the waves,
        that I may hear Thy Call.


  (At ye third repeating of ye incantation cast forth the Tablet into ye
waves saying):

  In His House at R'lyeh Dead Cthulhu waits dreaming, yet He shall
  rise and His kingdom shall cover the Earth.

affect the destructive power of your spells as well as mana points gain per 
level. In combat, intelligence helps you make critical hits and avoid

this stat, you'll be receiving more or less practice points for your 
skills. It will also affect your mana gain per level as well as some other

high dexterity, you'll be hitting your opponent more often and accurate, at 
the same time avoiding more blows. It's a general combat attribute.
   Constitution is what decides your combat endurance. High constitution 
character will have much more hit points to tank a combat. This is the most

DROW

Drow elves, like their surface dwelling cousins, are very
magical in their nature. The difference between the two lay in the fact
that Drow elves left the surface world for a subterranean existence. Drow
tend to dabble more in the "dark" arts of magic, and are evil in their
nature. Some Drow however are outcasts, and have decided to venture out to
the surface.

Drow elves are extremely good spellcasters, and are resistant to magic as
well. They are a lot weaker than humans physically, but compensate with a
greater intelligence. Drow are not as hardy as most races, but are more
dexterous than most as well.

Drow have developed the ability to see in the dark.
#
DRUID

 Druids draw their power from the earth, so their might stems not from dead
magic or capricious gods, but from the lifeforce of the earth itself.
Their abilities in some ways mimic the magical manipulative abilities of
adepts or the god-granted power of the clerics, but they go beyond, dealing
with primal Earthpower itself.
 Although they may not seem formidable in battle, any such preconception
will vanish when druid causes the very earth to open up beneath your feet!

This race is a more intelligent and magical race. Most of their
kind live in the forests, depending on the natural resources for their

world using their perceptive abilities and magical natures to some great
effect as the world's secrets are discovered.

Elves are quick-footed, as well as quick of wit. They are also well liked
if not loved by most races as well. Elves lack in strength, and can not
take much punishment in battle; but they are magical in nature and are
excellent spellcasters. In addition to their excellence in the use of
magic, elves are slightly resistant to the effects of magic as well.

Elves all have the ability to see in darkness.

#
GOBLIN

Small, tough and wily, Goblins are known for being good at a lot of
things, with the general exception of magic.  Quick and hardy, goblins
make excellent thieves due to their generally high dexterity and small
stature, though persistent individuals have managed in the past to
succeed at a wide variety of careers, including magical ones.

Goblins despise daylight, dwarves, elves, and humans, and prefer to
torture and tease any creatures which they may come across.  They also
conceive of trolls and ogres as utterly insufferable, generally because,
like orcs, these races tend to use their superior size and strength to
bully goblins into doing what they don't want to do.  Goblins will not
associate with Dwarves, due to long-standing tensions and a bloody
history between the two races, nor do they particularly like Elves (of
any type).  Dwarves are viewed with outright hatred, due to their
continued butchery of innocent goblins over countless centuries.  "The
only good part of a dwarf is his scalp" states a common Goblin proverb.

killing monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only be 
shared among group members that are in the same location, at the time of

must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Redferne: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group dragon"
Dragon  : "group redferne"

fascinated by Elves.  They consider them beautiful and mysterious, though

MUD

                    C  I  R  C  L  E  M  U  D     3  .  0

CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink, for submitting a veritable mountain of excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Furry (Alex Fletcher), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven, for porting the code to the Amiga.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns, for allowing Circle to exist.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- And, of course, Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.
...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!

MULTI

Multi spells are called so because they can not be cast by a single caster. 
In order to successfuly cast the spell caster must be grouped with other 
spell-casters (that means DRUIDS, MAGES or CLERICS). Their total mana must 
exceed the mana needed for casting the spell. Also every single caster must 
be at least MINLV level to participate in casting. MULTI spells are known 
for their undescribable either destructive or defensive powers.

OGRE

As a general rule, Ogres are big, mean, and dumb.  They make wonderful
warriors but generally feeble wizards and clerics, due to their innate
tendencies towards high strength and constitution and low intelligence
and wisdom. Their great size is often of use in combat as well, making
them excellent bashers. They are fond of treasure, and are often employed 
as mercenaries by evil races in particular. They tend to have yellowish 
hides, are covered with wart-like bumps, have black teeth and talons, and 
purplish eyes with white pupils. Ogres are exceptionally strong and hardy, 
but are known to be extremely dim-witted and lacking in wisdom. They are 
excellent in melee combat, but are extremely limited when they attempt to 
utilize magic. Ogre mages and clerics, rare though they may be,
are not unknown to the realms.

Ogres do not like little creatures, who tend to cause problems and/or
steal things.  If they cannot be bullied, they should be smashed.

RANGER

were first used in the great wars as quick moving, lightly armored
scouts during the ancient wars. Later, they were known as heavy
hitting elite strike forces with extensive training in woodcraft and
wilderness survival. In the peaceful years before the current era
they were primarily caretakers of the forests and wilder wilderness
areas near the big cities. In the current era of constant conflict
and wars, the Rangers are great survivors.

armor, even if it is of high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop 
by murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers 
are often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, 
surviving in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

sneaking. If you sucessfully sneak, then you'll continue to sneak for a 
little while.

SOCIALS

Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others.  The
actor, victim and bystanders may receive different messages.  Generally,
social commands are used only to express emotion, but it is possible that
some mobs (or players) will take action based on the social.

<social> [<victim>]

> shake homer
> applaud marge
> doh

The SOCIALS command generates a canonical listing of all available socials.

SPELL SPELLS MANA "SAVING THROW" SAVING_

Spells are ways for spellcasters to express their powers. In order to use
spells, one must spend some of his MANA energy.  Power of all damaging
spells is halved if the victim save a throw versus spell. Furthermore,
SANCTUARY will halve every damage creature is taking, so it will for the
spells. Protection spells (like prot lightning or prot fire) will also lower
the damage taken from corresponding spells. If fire spells are used during
wet conditions (eg. during rain or in water conditions) their damage is also
lowered. Also, intelligence of the caster greatly affects the destructive
power of his spells. At INT of 18 all spells will be casted with 100% power.
Higher INT means more power, lower INT means less.

For list of spells available to your class see help on your class.

SPLIT

Usage:  SPLIT <amount to split>

SPLIT is used to split money among people in your group who are in the same
room as you.  If you are in a group with 4 other people, all of whom are in
the same room with you, and you type SPLIT 100, you will give each of the
other 4 group members 20 coins each.  (100 coins is split 5 ways; you keep
your share and give everyone else their share).

#
SPY

  Spying helps a thief character gain information about the world 
around him/her.  After one has typed 'spy', one can look in various 
directions, and given that there is an exit in that direction, and nothing 
blocking the way (like a closed door), then the contents of the other room 
will be displayed.
#
STALK

Stalk allows you to follow someone completely unnoticed. No message is 
given to your victim that you are following them. Just make sure your not 
caught or your target might not be too happy with what evil plans you might 
be trying to come up with ;)
It is best combined with MOVE HIDDEN. 

See also: HIDE, SNEAK, MOVE HIDDEN
#
STEAL

Thief Only.

Use steal to steal gold or items from people. The chance of not getting
caught depends on how well you have practiced steal, and if the person
is asleep.

Due to misuse of the steal command, it is now illegal to steal from other
players.  Doing so will get you a flag for your trouble.

Example:

> steal gold drunk

> steal sword mercenary
  (only possible if he is sleeping)

#
STONESKIN

Usage       : cast 'stoneskin'

This makes the skin of the caster change into a stone-like material.  This 
will greatly improve the armor class and make the caster much more 
resistant to piercing attacks (daggers, pikes and such).  This is a 
personal spell, it cannot be cast on others.

Other spells of note:  ARMOR, BARKSKIN
#
STRENGTH

Usage       : cast 'strength' <victim>
Accumulative: duration

The victim will gain 1 strength point and another one if caster's level 
more or equals 32.

See Also: GIANT STRENGTH
#
STRING

For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters. The
format is:

string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.
Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):
Name                  (the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant)
Short                 (for inventory lists (obj's) and actions (char's))
Long                  (for when obj/character is seen in room)
Title                 (for players)
Description           (For look at. For obj's, must be followed by a keyword)
Delete-description    (only for obj's. Must be followed by keyword)

Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make you enter
a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to the string until
you exceed the maximum length for the string or you end a line with a '@'.

Mobiles and objects currently can not be strung.

STROM

 	                  STROM'S LOST LANDS

STROM'S LOST LANDS was developed from CircleMUD (3.00bpl8), which was 
developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0).

STROM'S LOST LANDS branched from kosher CircleMUD code by more than 20%.
And thus can be thought of as a derivative of Circle.

STROM'S LOST LANDS was developed by Billy Chan during many lunch breaks
and staying late through the night while working at WindRiver Systems.

I'd like to thank the following people for their help during the development
of STROM'S LOST LANDS:
  
  -- Mike Scheel for the wonderful testing and building.
  -- Clara Ko for understanding and giving me permission to MUD.
  -- Joe Hull and John Wier (theTick and Rimmer) for bug testing and building.
  -- Levork for Iedit and Redit.
  -- Josh Steadman, for some cool areas
  -- Silly MUD for the teleport rooms.
  -- The friends of Strom on Mortal Realms, for giving me the idea of what
     would make a good MUD.
  -- The CircleMUD folks and the DikuMUD folks, for starting the ball rolling.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
	Pink Floyd <floyd@south.mit.edu> for do_scan
	samedi for some of the OLC stuff
Thanks everyone!

STUN

Skillful thief can sneak up and STUN their victim, paralyzing them. Victim
will remain stunned for couple of seconds and can not retrieve from this
state alone, but it can be woken. Or BACKSTABED...

When stunned, victim will receive 2.33 times normal damage. Chances to stun
a victim who is under the affect of HASTE or ADRENALINE are lower.
#
STYLE

This command will change your fighting style. Possible arguments are
"normal", "evasive", "aggresive".
#
SUMMON

Usage       : cast 'summon' <victim>
Accumulative: -
Duration    : Instantaneous

Will summon a person of the name spoken.  You can summon only level's
less then you are. If you attempt to summon a monster, it will get a saving
throw, and you may wind up with the wrong monster.  You cannot summon from 
NO MAGIC rooms.  You cannot summon to TUNNEL or PRIVATE rooms, nor from 
PEACEFUL rooms.  You cannot summon someone who is fighting, as it is 
impossible to get a precise fix of their location.

See Also: RELOCATE, DIMENSION WALK, PORTAL
#
SUNRAY

Usage: cast 'sunray' 

By means of this spell, the caster causes an intense beam of light spread 
from his hands.  The intensity of the light is such that it might blind (as 
per spell) all the creatures in the room that are not grouped with the 
caster.
#
SURCEASE

Usage: cast 'surcease'

Surcease is the higher of the ranger's spells.  It provides a large
amount of healing to the ranger and their comrades after the heat of

#
SWEEPKICK

When praacticed enough, you can use this skill to sweep the floor below 
your opponent doing large amounts of damage and smashing him to the ground.

you stop attacking X, and attack Y...
#
SYNOST

Usage: cast 'synost' <victim>

Synost is a powerful spell that will allow you send your mana through the 
synost eter, converting it into target's hitpoints. Your target can be 
anywhere in the world, as the eter itself will find it. Every time you cast 
it you'll loose 1/5-th of your mana. During the transfer some of it 
will be lost. 
#
TELEPORT

Usage       : cast 'teleport' [self]

Teleport will instantly transfer you to another location in the world. This 
location is random, and thus there will always be a risk of landing in a 
fatal location (but not in a death trap).

See Also: LOCAL TELEPORT, SUMMON, RELOCATE, DIMENSION WALK, PORTAL
#
THIEF

  The thief is a person which exists alongside society, rather than within, 
or even necessarily without.  The thief lives by skills and cunning, and 
relies on the elements of surprise, trickery, and stealth.

  The prime requisite of thieves is dexterity which makes them very    
slippery opponents. Strength is desirable to make their primary attack,
the backstab, more powerful and to allow them to carry more loot.      
Intelligence is a big plus, allowing them to learn their skills quickly
and expertly as well as to assist their streetsmarts. And as with all  
classes, a hardy constitution will help them survive in the lethal     
dark alleyways and sidestreets of the big cities.                      
The following skills are available to thieves:

Level    Skill                         
------------------------------------
1 : Backstab, Sneak, Fillet, Cook, Enhanced sight
2 : Hide
3 : Dodge
4 : Steal
5 : Move hidden
6 : Track
7 : Consider
8 : Trip
9 : Listen
10: Pick lock
11: Feign death
12: Peek
13: Second attack
14: Haggle
16: Improved steal
18: Plant
19: Dual wield
20: Shield block
22: Spy
23: Escape
25: Gouge
26: Scare
28: Forge
30: Stalk
32: Dual backstab
35: Circle
39: Stun
#
TIME

Gives you the current game time.  Your initial reaction to the output of
this command may be one of surprise, but you'll get used to it.  You'll
have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this
particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.
#
TITLE

Sets the title people see on the WHO list and when you're in the room with
them.  You can't use parentheses (the "(" and ")" characters) because those
are reserved for flags.

You can use ANSI colors in your title. See help on ANSI.

See also:  FLAGS, ANSI
#
TOGGLE

TOGGLE shows you the current values of various toggles available on the 
MUD. This command CAN NOT be used to change these values (see related 
commands.) All of these toggles remain the same until you change them; i.e. 
they are saved when you quit or rent.

#
TORNADO

Usage: cast 'tornado'

Upon casting this spell, druid will try to conjure a tornado that will 
attack all the creatures in the room doing 2dlevel of damage. More 
important is that the tornado will blow away some creatures (depending on 
their weight) out of the room.
#
TRACK

Used for finding the first step on the shortest route to a person/monster. 
If you didn't learn it well enough, you might get wrong route.

> track fido
#
TRAIN

There is no old fashioned way training in Land of Myst. Stats are improved
by equipment and spells. Only way to permamently improve one's stat is
having a powerful druid cast 'improve stat' on you.

See help on STAT to learn more.
#
TRANSPORT

Usage: cast 'transport' <object>

Druid can use this spells to transport an item to the druid's holy place, 
well hidden to other beings. Those items can then be retransfered with the 
RETRANSPORT spell. All the items are being stored to one location.
#
TRIP

Trip is a skill similar to the BASH skill except it can only be performed
by skillful thieves. When you trip someone, they'll fall to the ground
making them an easier target to hit and damage, without chance to fight
back. If you fail you'll find yourself on the ground.

See also: BASH
#
TROLL

Trolls are big and slow.  Make that BIG.  Known for their prowess in
battle, their superior physical attributes, and their great size, Trolls
are known to be unsurpassed warriors.  Along with these physical traits
comes a particular dimness of mind and of senses, and Trolls able to cast
spells are rare, and often less than competent.
#
UNGROUP

UNGROUP can be used by group leaders to disband the entire group, or
to kick a specific group member out of the group (and stop him/her from
following the leader).

> ungroup
> ungroup homer

See also: GROUP
#
USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS

Use : Use <Staff>
      Use <Wand> <Target>

Using staff's will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, execpt yourself. Therefore staff's are naturally very powerful, and
yet may be very dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be eihter a
character or an object.

Both staff's and wand's must be HELD in the hand prior to use! (Use the
grab or hold commands). You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.
#
VALUE

Before selling an item to a shop, you can ask the shopkeeper how much
he or she is willing to pay for it.

Also, you can value an item in the shopkeeper's inventory to see whether
you can use that item or not.
Example:
 
> value bread

throw, the spell will make the object or victim appear to say the
text written. People saving will only notice that someone tired

energy, for the duration of few hours.
#
WAKE SLEEPING REST SIT STAND

to sit and rest for a while, or maybe even take a nap. By doing this you 
restore your hit, mana and movement points faster than usual.
#
WARRIOR FIGHTER

 It seems that most cultures have one thing in common, a need      
for warriors. These are the men and women who train from birth      
to survive the lethal environment of close combat with weapons      
and armor. These soldiers, mercenaries, guards, etc. utilize        
their knowledge of armor, weapons, and tactics to great effect.     
While they may not have a lot of skills with which to draw from,    
the skills they do learn are extremely effective, and are generally 
learned quite early.  The only drawback of the warrior lies in      
its main strength, its simplicity.                                  
  The prime requisite of Warriors is strength, giving them the      
capacity to mete out more damage, and carry more gear and           
equipment than any other class.                                     
The following skills are available to warriors:

Level    Skill                      
------------------------------------
1 : Fillet, Enhanced sight, Cook
2 : Kick
4 : Enhanced damage
5 : Bash
6 : Consider
7 : Parry
8 : Track
9 : Rescue
10: Second attack
12: Shield block
13: Battlecry
15: Dual wield
18: Berserk
20: Third attack
24: Disarm
26: Switch
28: Archirage
30: Second dual attack
32: Guard
34: Forge
36: Melee
39: Behead
42: Fourth attack
44: Fame

#
WEAKEN

Usage       : cast 'weaken' <victim>
Accumulative: duration

This spell makes the victim weaker by two strength points. Casting this 
spell generally irritates the victim.
 
#
WEAR

If you want to wear some clothes, armor or the likes.

Also, to wear everything in your inventory (or at least try to, as wearing 
things like loaves of bread is not a good way to win friends and influence
people) you can type "wear all".

Optionally, you can specify what part of your body to wear the equipment on.

> wear boots
> wear all.bronze
> wear all
> wear ring finger

See also: EQUIPMENT, REMOVE EQUIPMENT
#

If you're uncertain whether the sun is shining or the rain is pouring down.
#

ability to easily leave the room, flee and to dodge attacks. It will 
also lower the victim's dexterity by two. Given time the victim will be 
able to break out of the web.
You can use the 'struggle' command once you find yourself in the web.
#
WHERE

Immortals may type 'where' without arguments to see where everybody is.

> where
> where torch
> where dragon
#
WHIRLWIND

If you are wielding two weapons, this will cause you to spin rapidly, 
hitting everything in the room. However, there is a chance you'll loose 
your balance and fall to the ground, being an easy target to hit.
#
